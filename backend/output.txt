It doesn\\u2019t have hundreds of years of history, but I can tell you, this dish is a legend in the making. It\\u2019s so popular in China now that there are tons of restaurant chains like NaDu (\\u62ff\\u6e21) and ChuanChengYuan (\\u5ddd\\u6210\\u5143) thriving on just this one dish.\\n\\nMa la xiang guo is very heavily spiced, but not just by chilies alone. There are tons of spices added, that until now were mostly a delicious delicious mystery to us. Living in Beijing, we couldn\\u2019t get enough of this dish\\u2013\\u2013spicy food lovers will rejoice when they taste it! I recently made this dish (minus the fish balls) for a vegan friend, he said that this is the best dish he ever had at our house.\\n\\n![Image 2: Ma La Xiang Guo (Spicy Numbing Stir-fry Pot), by thewoksoflife.com](blob:http://localhost/40956585f33b57a3d7308aa932a1bbd7)\\n\\nTo show you why we were so obsessed with it, let me shed some light on how it\\u2019s done in a Ma La Xiang Guo restaurant. A server hands you a menu after you are seated. You\\u2019ll notice that everything on the menu consists of raw ingredients, and each comes with a price. (Side note: I love Chinese menus. They have the thickness of a miniature novel with so many dishes to choose from, and every dish has a picture, name and price\\u2014so there\\u2019s no need to guess what you are ordering. Most of the time, I like to keep the menu even after ordering so I can marvel at the dishes that I did not order. Sorry, now back to our topic\\u2026)\\n\\nAfter examining all the delectable choices, you pick your choice of meats, tofus, seafood, and vegetables. There is really no right or wrong way to make your selections, so go ahead, be a picky eater and only select ingredients that you fancy. Eight to ten ingredients is perfect for four to six people; any more and you\\u2019ll be served up a mountain of food with nowhere to go other than the back of your fridge.\\n\\nThe server then will ask you how spicy you like it, from mild, to medium, to hot. My advice is to go slow if this is your first time, and select the mild, which I think is the right amount of heat for optimal enjoyment. After a short wait, a large vessel of piping hot and delicious ma la xiang guo will appear at your table, along with rice for everyone. BTW, don\\u2019t forget to order plenty of water. You will need it.\\n\\nAt mom-and-pop restaurants, fast-food chains, and food courts, you can select ingredients in a buffet-style line, and they are ordered by weight. After you make the selections, they weigh the vegetables separately, because protein costs more. This dish can definitely become expensive very fast. Last time, we ordered it in the Flushing Mall\\u2019s food court and were so disappointed\\u2014it tasted nothing like what we had in Beijing. So what do I do? Find a way to make it myself, of course!\\n\\nThis recipe is mostly vegetables, but we added some fish balls, because let\\u2019s face it, who doesn\\u2019t like fish balls? Just remember\\u2026all the vegetables need to be blanched first. And if you want to add meats like chicken and/or beef, marinate them with a little oil, cornstarch, and soy sauce first and sear them separately so they are cooked before you add them in with the rest of the ingredients. Another a quick tip: a great time to make this dish is at the end of the week, when you find yourself with a little of this and some of that, and don\\u2019t know what to do with the ingredients. Simply combine all the ingredients to make a wonderful, vibrant new dish.\\n\\n![Image 3: Ma La Xiang Guo (Spicy Numbing Stir-fry Pot), by thewoksoflife.com](blob:http://localhost/40956585f33b57a3d7308aa932a1bbd7)\\n\\n**For the vegetables:**\\n\\n*   3 celery stalks, thinly sliced\\n*   2 carrots, thinly sliced\\n*   2 potatoes, sliced\\n*   2 cups rehydrated [wood-ear mushrooms(\\u9ed1\\u6728\\u8033)](https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-dried-preserved-ingredients/#wood-ears), rinsed and drained\\n*   3 long pieces of rehydrated [tofu bean threads](https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-tofu-bean-curd/#bean-thread) (F\\u01d4zh\\u00fa \\u8150\\u7af9), drained\\n*   4-6 shiitake (rehydrated if using [dried shiitake](https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-dried-preserved-ingredients/)) mushrooms, washed and sliced\\n*   a handful of sliced [lotus root](https://thewoksoflife.com/asian-vegetables-beans-melons/#lotus-root)\\n\\n![Image 4: Ma La Xiang Guo (Spicy Numbing Stir-fry Pot), by thewoksoflife.com](blob:http://localhost/303491554690601ccb6b6716a2cdb2ef)\\n\\nFirst, bring a pot of water to a boil, and blanch all the vegetables (potatoes and carrots will take slightly more time), then transfer to an ice bath.

It\'s been a while and we had very snowy and cold winter in St. Louis! This winter I was trapped inside a lot because of the cold weather. So I wanted to make a dish that I craved when I felt a little blue and it is mala xiang guo. This mala xiang guo stir fry dish uses Haidilao spicy stir fry mix and you can create it with anything you have in your fridge in just 15 minutes! Just throw in the vegetables, tofu and meat and there you got it!! It\'s super easy and super satisfying :) If you like this video, make sure to give me a thumbs up so more people can see my videos! Follow my IG @YiSichuanKitchen Also do you have a go-to dish for cold weather and when you feel down? Let me know in the comment because I do believe food can heal our body and heart! Here is the ingredients: Beef meat ball (cut in half) Pork belly (sliced ) Lotus root (sliced) Potato (sliced) Celtuce (also called \\"stem lettuce\\" and wo sun in Chinese) Enoki mushroom Shiitake mushroom Bean curd (fuzhu, soak in water ) Green onion 4-5 Ginger 1 piece Garlic 7-8 Hotpot mix 1 bag Peppercorn 1 tbsp Dried chili a handful Hot water cook meat and veggies ingredients Add oil in wok, add ginger and garlic, add peppercorn and dried chili Add hot pot mix Add in meatball, pork belly Cooking wine Add in veggies Add salt if needed Top with green onion and sesame More recipes?

Well, I\\u2019m going to call out a potential darkhorse dish which I hope will get it\\u2019s time on the podium soon - _Mala Dry Pot._\\n\\nNow, you may be thinking \\u201cWhat the heck is that, Phil?\\u201d - and I wouldn\\u2019t judge you. That\\u2019s because it seems to be a relatively niche dish at least here along the East Coast of the USA. I\\u2019ve only found it in 2 restaurants I\\u2019ve been to to date, and if you know how much I enjoy going to restaurants big and small, you know this dish must be a relatively rare thing. But I\\u2019ll let you in on a hint of what it is - you\\u2019ve probably heard of [Sichuan Hot Pot](https://thewoksoflife.com/hot-pot/), right? Those bubbling cauldrons of spicy, red-tinged and oil slicked broth where people are dunking in thin slices of meat, seafood, and vegetables and dipping them in all types of sauces? Well Mala Dry Pot is Hot Pot\\u2019s more assertive, bolder cousin - you know, the one that has a motorbike, enjoys wearing a leather jacket with a sherpa collar, and will go up to anyone at a bar and chat them up? That guy.\\n\\n_Anywho_ - Mala Dry Pot is a truly superior dish not only because it\\u2019s arguably event tastier than the more known Mala Hot Pot, but also because it\\u2019s easier to make and requires much less clean up and prep. If you\\u2019re a fan of spicy, savory food that will make you come back craving more, this one\\u2019s for you.\\n\\n_Let\\u2019s dive in._\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n**What is Chinese Mala Dry Pot?**So you may be thinking _\\"why is this dish a dark horse?\\"_ Well, aside from being relatively not well known at least in most parts of the USA, it has all the makings of a hype worthy dish. It\\u2019s full of bold flavor, it\'s infinitely customizable, it\'s very photogenic, and it\\u2019s made to be shared by a group - so you know it will be perfect for TikTokers to monologue over in a video. Once it starts gaining visibility as hot pot has, I expect it to enter the cultural zeitgeist in no time.\\n\\nSo what is Mala Dry Pot? To sum it up, it\\u2019s a spicy, savory, and very saucy stir fry at its heart. The \\u201cdry\\u201d of Mala Dry Pot comes from the fact that it\\u2019s not served in or with a full pot of broth like it\\u2019s cousin Sihuan hot pot is. While the mix of spices and flavors can vary, my preference, and how I\\u2019ve seen dry pot usually prepared, is choosing, prepping, and pre-cooking a mix of vegetables and proteins and quickly stir frying it with a sauce featuring a lively mix of spices, aromatics, soy and chili sauces, and fresh herbs to create a extremely fragrant, spicy, and tingly dish.\\n\\nThe core flavors of Mala dishes - szechuan peppercorn, chilis, cumin, star anise, and more feature right up front in Mala Dry Pot. These provide the robust base flavors while fresh herbs and vegetables act as the foil to bring brightness and balance. Honestly, it\\u2019s hard to describe in words, so please trust me when I say it\\u2019s a flavor I sometimes dream about.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n![Image 2: Picture](https://www.suitandapron.com/uploads/3/7/2/1/37213807/published/20221113-192718.jpg?1676238327)\\n\\nPrepping for Mala Dry Pot\\n\\nNow that I\\u2019ve hopefully sold you on giving this dish a try, there are a few steps in the lead up and prep for making dry pot. Here\\u2019s a few tips to start:\\n\\nBalance flavor and texture when picking your protein and vegetables - Remember, we eat with all our senses, so when picking what meat and proteins you want to include, get a variety of colors, textures, and flavors to really make it your own. I recommend selecting 2-3 proteins and at least 2-3 core vegetables for dry pot - that way you can enjoy mixing and matching bites.\\n\\n*   _Example Proteins:_\\n    *   Thinly sliced steak (use more tender cuts like sirloin or filet)\\n    *   Sliced chicken\\n    *   Spam\\n    *   Fried tofu (Unfried tofu may break apart)\\n    *   Shrimp\\n    *   Fish cakes or balls\\n\\n*   _Example Vegetables:_\\n    *   Bok choy\\n    *   Enoki or sliced shiitake mushrooms\\n    *   Chinese broccoli\\n    *   Bean sprouts\\n    *   Carrots\\n    *   Bamboo shoots\\n    *   Napa cabbage\\n    *   Lotus root\\n\\n*   _Other Ideas:_\\n    *   Mini dumplings or wontons\\n    *   Rice cakes\\n    *   Rice noodles\\n\\nPre-Cutting and Cooking your Ingredients - This is a critical step in making mala dry pot and helps make sure things go smoothly once you get to the final stages of cooking.\\n\\n*   _Make sure your pieces are all cut into large but bite-sized pieces_ - You don\\u2019t need something that is very small here. Cut your proteins and veg into pieces that are hearty, without making you have to unhinge your jaw\\n*   _Cook ingredients individually and have them set aside at the ready to go_ - The method you use here can vary, but I tend to like to brown and stir fry meats and hearty vegetables like carrots in oil until just cooked on the outside, and blanche leafy vegetables like bok choy until crisp-tender in a pot of salted boiling water. It\\u2019s ok if they cool down while you prep the other ingredients, you will heat them up again in the final stir fry with the sauce.\\n*   _Measure out your spices and sauces ahead of time_ - At the very end of cooking, you will be making the sauce for your dry pot and it will come together relatively quickly, so you don\\u2019t want to be fumbling around in the depths of your spice cabinet looking for cumin or bay leaves while your other spices are starting to burn. Pre-measure your spices and put them into a small dish and do the same with your liquid sauces. You can always adjust more later if you want more heat or salt or sugar. Also feel free to adjust your level of spice - add or reduce the amount of chili to your taste buds - no judgment here.\\n*   _Don\\u2019t skip on the fresh herbs_ - What takes Mala Dry Pot from A-Tier to S-Tier is the final topping of fresh herbs. Cilantro is traditional and preferred here, but fresh green onion is also wonderful and thai basil could also be a fun twist.\\n\\nHave Lots of Rice - Make more than you think you will need - I\\u2019m just going to leave it at that.\\n\\nAlright - well you\\u2019ve heard enough from me - here\\u2019s my recipe for a Mala Dry Pot. Again, my choice of meats and vegetables were purely based on what I was craving at the time, but I encourage you to create your own mix.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\nRecipe: Chinese Mala Dry Pot\\n\\nServes: 2-3\\n\\nIngredients:\\n\\n*   1/2 Can of Spam, sliced into bite-sized pieces\\n*   10-12 oz. Steak, sirloin or strip recommended, cut into bite-sized pieces\\n*   1 Large carrot, sliced thin into bite sized pieces\\n*   5-6 Napa cabbage leaves, cut into large pieces\\n*   2-3 Shanghai or Baby Bok Choy - Cut into fourths, leaving the base attached\\n*   1 Package sliced shiitake mushrooms - About 4 Oz (or substitute enoki mushrooms)\\n*   3-4 Cloves garlic, roughly chopped\\n*   1-inch Piece of ginger, roughly chopped\\n*   Handful of Cilantro, roughly chopped\\n*   1 tsp Sesame seeds\\n*   Vegetable Oil\\n\\nSauce and Spices:\\n\\n*   2 tsp Ground cumin\\n*   1 tsp Five spice\\n*   1-2 tsp Szechuan peppercorns, crushed between your fingertips until fragrant\\n*   1/2 - 3/4 tsp Szechuan or red pepper flakes\\n*   2 Bay leaves\\n*   2 Whole star anise\\n*   1 Tbl Light Soy Sauce\\n*   1 Tsp Dark Soy Sauce\\n*   1 Tbl White sugar\\n*   1 tsp Chinese black vinegar (substitute balsamic if needed)\\n*   1 tsp Shaoxing cooking wine (Substitute dry sherry if needed)\\n*   2 tsp. Spicy Chili Crisp\\n*   1 generous tsp Chili Bean Sauce (AKA [Touban Jian or Doubanjiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubanjiang))\\n*   Vegetable Oil\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\n1.   Prepare your meats and vegetables by slicing them into large, bite-sized pieces. Set aside until ready to cook\\n2.   Combine your dry spices on a small plate or bowl, and combine your sauces except for the chili-bean paste in a separate bowl. Set aside until ready to cook\\n3.   In a large pan, heat up a thin layer of oil and brown your proteins until just cooked and taking on brown color on the outside - set aside\\n4.   Cook your firm vegetables, like carrots, in the same pan until just starting to get tender, about 2-3 minutes - set aside\\n5.   Cook your mushrooms until they have released their liquids and are soft - about 3-5 minutes - set aside\\n6.   In a large pot of boiling salted water, quickly blanche your napa cabbage and bok choy for 1-2 minutes until cooked but still crisp - remove from the water and set aside\\n7.   Once all main proteins and vegetables are prepared, return the large pan over medium-low heat. Add about 3 tablespoons of oil to the pan and add the dry spices, garlic, and ginger. Stir until spices are fragrant - about 1 minute.\\n8.   Add the chili bean paste and stir into the oil mixture - cook 1-minute more until fragrant\\n9.   Add the remaining sauce ingredients, raise the heat to medium, and bring to a boil\\n10.   Turn heat to medium-high and add all the prepped proteins and vegetables back into the pan. Stir to coat all the ingredients in the sauce and let the sauce start to thicken and glaze everything - 2-3 minutes. Taste and adjust the dish as needed with salt, sugar, or chili to taste. If the sauce is too loose, you can thicken it with a cornstarch slurry.\\n11.   Remove the pan from the heat and dish onto a large serving dish or platter - sprinkle generously with fresh chopped cilantro and a sprinkle of sesame seeds\\n12.   Serve family style with lots of rice and enjoy\\n\\nLet me know if you enjoyed trying this out in the comments below. _**Cheers!**_\\n\\n![Image 3](https://www.suitandapron.com/uploads/3/7/2/1/37213807/20221113-183652_orig.jpg)Suit and Apron -------------- No celebrity chef got to the top without getting burned, cut, and spilled on at least a couple dozen times.

It is a steamed stodgy cake made with rice flour and mooli/daikon. Usually seen or served pan fried in slices. This cake is a Cantonese favourite for Chinese new year and is available in all Cantonese dim sum restaurants all year round. This fried cake in dim sum restaurant normally looks pure white and quite plain with few minute pieces of Chinese sausage etc, the seasoning is usually msg, salt and some sugar. Homemade lo bak goh usually without msg and contains more \\u6599 \'lieu\' or added ingredients, also the adding of soy sauce can make the cake looks not as white as those in restaurant. Chinese \'wax\' meat or preserved meat like lap cheong (sausage) or lap yuk (bacon), minced pork, dried shrimps or dried scallops are common ingredients added for flavour and texture.\\n\\n[![Image 2](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVO1iaukuvpJOnh9F31MZTIxgG2HLwJEPGJeOe-_OZCCC-ZPVgTs9rA8EyPdiIxQYxEMeNnnJ13iBzTi7T0KiPzmbn3v8NL3G9Lv-MZzN1pNvaMN7c7uzmtrnHumwm_ToOzfVwHbV83uLC/s400/DSC02135.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVO1iaukuvpJOnh9F31MZTIxgG2HLwJEPGJeOe-_OZCCC-ZPVgTs9rA8EyPdiIxQYxEMeNnnJ13iBzTi7T0KiPzmbn3v8NL3G9Lv-MZzN1pNvaMN7c7uzmtrnHumwm_ToOzfVwHbV83uLC/s1600-h/DSC02135.jpg)\\n\\nHere is how I normally make this savoury cake.\\n\\nIngredients:\\n\\n2 - 2.5 stick lap cheong (chinese sausage)\\n\\n100g skinless lap yuk (chinese bacon) or 100 -125g minced pork\\n\\n2 tbsp dried shrimps, soaked\\n\\nabout 3 dried shitake mushroom (about 10g), soaked removed stalk\\n\\n2 dried scallop, soaked and shredded (optional)\\n\\n2 - 3 walnut size shallots\\n\\n2 decent size clove garlic\\n\\npinch of ground pepper\\n\\n0.5 - 1 tsp salt or to taste\\n\\n1 - 2 tsp light soy sauce\\n\\nabout 750 - 800g peeled mooli or daikon\\n\\nabout 250ml water (can use the soaking water for dried shrimps and dried scallop to replace this water)\\n\\n280g rice flour\\n\\n50g tapioca starch or potato starch\\n\\n300ml room temp. homemade chicken stock (or water with added chicken stock granules about 1 heap tsp)\\n\\n1 tsp sesame oil\\n\\ncooking oil\\n\\nMethod:\\n\\n1.   Soak the lap cheong and lap yuk (if using) in boiling liquid for few minutes till soften then finely chopped. \\n2.   Finely chopped garlic, shallot, soaked mushrooms and dried shrimps. \\n3.   Grate mooli/daikon. I used the food processor grater, saves a lot of work. For a very fine cake texture and save cooking time can also puree the mooli using the food processor.\\n\\n4.   Mix rice flour, starch, sesame oil and stock together.\\n\\n5.   Heat wok with few tbsp oil and fry shallot and garlic till soften. Then add sausage, bacon (or minced pork), dried shrimps, mushroom and scallop (if using). Fry till fragrant, and make sure meat does not clump together then add remaining seasoning ingredients. Remove to one side. Check if the wok has any brown sticky bits, if yes wash before proceeding to next step. Browning bits can make the cake looks greyish or brownish.\\n\\n6.   Stir fry mooli with a little oil for about 2 minutes then add 250ml water and cook for few minutes till the mooli is softened.\\n\\n7.   Stir in flour mixture, taste to check if more seasoning is needed and cook at low heat stirring all the time for till the mixture started to thicken like runny porridge before it gets too thick heat off.\\n\\n8.   Grease a large casserole dish or non loose base aluminium baking tin or 2 - 3 disposable foil oblong/round containers. Pour cake mixture into dish/container, smooth the top with dampen fingers lightly touching the surface. Ready for steaming. For one large cake this will take about 1.5 hour, for a smaller cake about 1 hour. Test with a skewer into the centre to see there is no whitish paste to ensure it is thoroughly cooked through. Once cooked, take the cake out cover loosely and leave to cool. If without a large enough steamer can cook the cake in the oven using a water bath (large roasting tray filled with some boiling water) covered with foil.\\n\\n9.   Can be eaten while warm as it is or cut into slices when cooled and fry with a little oil till both sides are golden brown. It is much easier to slice if the cake is cooled in the fridge for few hours or overnight.\\n\\nServe the cake with or without frying with [Cantonese chilli oil](http://sunflower-recipes.blogspot.com/2009/07/cantonese-hong-kong-style-chilli-oil.html), XO sauce, soy sauce or any favourite chilli sauce.\\n\\nThis cake will keep in the fridge for 4 - 5 days or frozen in chunk. If frozen, defrost before frying.\\n\\n17 Feb 2010\\n\\nAttached is a picture from [PlumLeaf](http://alittlebitofplumleaf.blogspot.com/) who has followed this recipe. She got it wrong using hot stock to mix the dry flour but the cakes did turn out looking good.\\n\\n[![Image 3](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjn-06kShKe470xSACr1WzFiF_UG3uWFykxGm-77Q_MAyViskDydcZ8sj-VBLbvJ-MGl7Gs-DruRV_XhW5PobxDasXrYPGyWKZnCtkEaoTyBpLoGMd2WpWmeHgmGCpkiaIVYEkwv7ltLEE/s400/lobakgoh.JPG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjn-06kShKe470xSACr1WzFiF_UG3uWFykxGm-77Q_MAyViskDydcZ8sj-VBLbvJ-MGl7Gs-DruRV_XhW5PobxDasXrYPGyWKZnCtkEaoTyBpLoGMd2WpWmeHgmGCpkiaIVYEkwv7ltLEE/s1600-h/lobakgoh.JPG)\\n\\n[![Image 4](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiXskRDdyM15sdzxWvGZyccwkcf3UDxcacdvbn5PQtqA09mgUlhAO2CO3GtDDEdJ6Hi2YhFc8sW8MJg0Vx9cx8ymRdJhVz7RGLCyoOeXiy8j0wZb-BQjAGFVxwF4Ma7-cHQYZuXiur1Zz27/s200/taro+cake.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiXskRDdyM15sdzxWvGZyccwkcf3UDxcacdvbn5PQtqA09mgUlhAO2CO3GtDDEdJ6Hi2YhFc8sW8MJg0Vx9cx8ymRdJhVz7RGLCyoOeXiy8j0wZb-BQjAGFVxwF4Ma7-cHQYZuXiur1Zz27/s1600-h/taro+cake.jpg)\\n\\nIf you like this type of cake you may also like[taro cake](http://sunflower-recipes.blogspot.com/2009/03/taro-yam-cake-woo-tau-koh.html)."}]', name='jina_search', id='9d6bc3fd-f426-4783-8671-fdbf27512676', tool_call_id='20e81705-366a-442c-8353-5dc8bdb8707a'), AIMessage(content="Okay, I will search the web for 'singaporean dry mala recipe' using the Jina Search tool.", additional_kwargs={'function_call': {'name': 'jina_search', 'arguments': '{"query": "singaporean dry mala recipe"}'}}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.0-flash', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run--a1ea4f32-6cf3-4e90-a8e4-5ae77b80730d-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'jina_search', 'args': {'query': 'singaporean dry mala recipe'}, 'id': '17e7ebeb-0ee7-4a03-9dca-64365110b194', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 26713, 'output_tokens': 34, 'total_tokens': 26747, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}}), ToolMessage(content='[{"title": "Ma La Xiang Guo (Spicy Numbing Stir-fry Pot) - The Woks of Life", "link": "https://thewoksoflife.com/ma-la-xiang-guo", "snippet": "This recipe is mostly vegetables, but we added some fish balls  Mala Xiangguo. serves: 6 servings.

Please read our [disclosure policy.](https://whattocooktoday.com/disclosure-and-privacy-policy)_\\n\\n**If you love spicy numbing food, then you need to meet ma la xiang guo. It is spicy and numbing, yet you can\\u2019t stop eating it. I\\u2019m sharing how you can easily make ma la xiang guo at home using hai di lao mala sauce and also how you can make your own mala sauce if you choose to.**\\n\\n![Image 1: Easy Ma La Xiang Guo At Home (Spicy Numbing Stir-fry)](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-8.jpg)\\n\\n I remember a few years ago when we were visiting Chicago, my husband found this Sichuan restaurant and we were craving spicy food then and I immediately ordered ma la xiang guo. The portion was HUGE! I mean, HUGE! It was filled with TONS of seafood and meat and oh gosh\\u2026lots of Sichuan peppercorns and the super spicy ma la sauce. I considered myself a person who can really eat spicy food and this ma la xiang guo was off the chart spicy! LOL AND numbing! but we loved it so much!\\n\\n Spicy ma la food sure has caught its trend in Singapore or I should say, outside of China, in recent years. From the spicy mala hot pot and now the dry version of hot pot, the ma la xiang guo! When you eat ma la xiang guo in restaurants, you picked your ingredients, they will weigh them on the scale (yup!) and the cook will fry up ma la xian guo using what you picked! It can cost you quite a bit. I think ma la xiang guo made at home is just as delicious, and the nice thing about it is that, you can use whatever ingredients you have leftover or you can go all out and put in whatever you fancy.\\n\\n**Easy Homemade Ma la Sauce vs Hai Di Lau Ma la sauce**\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf this is your first time making ma la xiang guo, I suggest using the [Hai Di Lau ma la basic stir-fry sauce](https://amzn.to/3dTUko3) (not sponsored). It\\u2019s just so much more convenient and it gives you that satisfying level of spiciness and numbness. I actually use the Hai Di Lau ma la hotpot sauce that I purchased for making hotpot but didn\\u2019t end up using it. They are very similar. You are of course, welcome to use whatever ma la stir-fry sauce you like, you don\\u2019t have to use this brand. For homemade ma la sauce I\\u2019ve tried using [Lao Gan Ma chili crisp in oil](https://amzn.to/3yOLtfv) and then add some Szechuan peppercorns and some seasonings and it actually turns out pretty good too.\\n\\n![Image 2: Easy Ma La Xiang Guo At Home (Spicy Numbing Stir-fry)](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-9.jpg)\\n\\n### MY LATEST VIDEOS\\n\\nnext\\n\\nstay\\n\\nCC\\n\\nSettings Off Arabic Chinese English French German Hindi Portuguese Spanish\\n\\nFont Color white Font Opacity 100%Font Size 100%Font Family Arial Text Shadow none Background Color black Background Opacity 50%Window Color black Window Opacity 0%\\n\\nWhite Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan\\n\\n100%75%50%25%\\n\\n200%175%150%125%100%75%50%\\n\\nArial Georgia Garamond Courier New Tahoma Times New Roman Trebuchet MS Verdana\\n\\nNone Raised Depressed Uniform Drop Shadow\\n\\nWhite Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan\\n\\n100%75%50%25%0%\\n\\nWhite Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan\\n\\n100%75%50%25%0%\\n\\n**Ingredients suitable for ma la xiang guo**\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou can use pretty much whatever your heart desires. Here are just some suggestions in case you need some ideas\\n\\n**1. Veggies**\\n\\n Veggies need to be bite-size or thinly sliced and usually blanched before stir-frying.\\n\\n You can use bok choy, cabbage, slices of carrots, baby corn, broccoli florets, shiitake mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, wood ear mushrooms, lotus roots, potato slices\\n\\n**2. Meat**\\n\\n Thinly sliced beef, chicken, pork, meatballs, luncheon meat (cut into cubes or slices), hot dogs (cut into cubes or slices)\\n\\n**3. Seafood**\\n\\n Shrimp, squid, fish cake slices, fish balls, surimi\\n\\n**4. Meatless protein**\\n\\n Beancurd sticks (soak until soft), extra-firm tofu (cut into cubes or slices), tempeh (cut into cubes or slices)\\n\\n**5. Noodles or carbs**\\n\\n Instant noodles, mung bean thread noodles, Korean sweet potato noodles, Chinese or Korean rice cakes\\n\\n**6. Low-carb options**\\n\\n Shirataki noodles, konnyaku jelly (cut into cubes)\\n\\n**How to cook easy ma la xiang guo at home**\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\n1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add cabbage, potatoes and lotus roots and blanch for about 1-2 minutes. Drain off water and refresh with cold water and set aside\\n\\n![Image 3](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-10.jpg)\\n\\n 2. Whatever noodles you use, cook them according to the instruction. I use instant ramen noodles. Don\\u2019t overcook the noodles\\n\\n![Image 4](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-1-1.jpg)\\n\\n 3. Preheat your skillet or wok. If you use ready-made ma la sauce, add about 3-4 Tbsp of the sauce, or in my case, I use 1/2 pack of Hai Di Lao ma la sauce. If you decide to do the homemade ma la sauce, add about 3 Tbsp of lao gan ma chili and Sichuan peppercorns. The amount is really up to your tolerance\\n\\n![Image 5](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-2.jpg)\\n\\n 4. Add the shrimp and stir fry until they just started to turn pink. If you use meat slices, add them here too. Add the fish cakes along with the blanched veggies, noodles and whole dried chilies. Add seasonings and stir to mix everything to make sure they are coated with the ma la sauce. Have a taste, at this point if you feel like you need more, you can add more of the ma la sauce. Turn off the heat\\n\\n![Image 6](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-4.jpg)\\n\\n 5. Add the toasted nuts, sesame seeds, green onion and give them a final toss to mix everything. Garnish with some fresh cilantro leaves. Serve immediately\\n\\n![Image 7](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-5.jpg)\\n\\nMa la xiang guo stir-fry is ready in no time \\ud83d\\ude42 My husband loves Sichuan peppercorns and so this dish is needless to say, one of his favorites.

Almost every hawker centre now has this stir fried dish where you can customise the vegetables, proteins and noodles that go in. You can also choose your spice level and add garnishes like cilantro and peanuts if you prefer. Overall, the customisation of the dish ensures anyone and everyone is able to enjoy it and no matter what it\\u2019s packed with flavour!\\n\\nAnd it\\u2019s not just the chillies that flavour this dish \\u2013 it also includes spices like garlic, sichuan pepper, 5-spice powder and most importantly, hot bean paste. It\\u2019s usually shared between 2 to even more than 6 people sometimes with a huge mega dry pot. It\\u2019s crazy how much people love eating Mala Xiang Guo as a social experience (myself included!)\\n\\nIn restaurants, there are so many delectable dishes to select from \\u2013 you can pick your choice of protein, different types of beancurd, and vegetables. There is really no right or wrong way to construct your bowl but generally if it\\u2019s just the two of us \\u2013 were pick around 4-5 dishes in a reasonable quantity.\\n\\n![Image 2](https://browngirlveganeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/photo1705849696-1.jpeg)\\n\\nI used to be so crazy about this dish once that I swore my future partner had to like this dish if not we were just not meant to be \\u2013 I got lucky that my partner loves it too ![Image 3: \\ud83d\\ude09](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/svg/1f609.svg) However, I always preferred to prepare this dish at home as it was much healthier than ones you find outside (sometimes it\\u2019s loaded with oils and you can\\u2019t really tell if it\\u2019s truly vegan unless it\\u2019s a vegetarian place). My favourite vegan mala dry pot has got to be Green On Earth, Rail Mall \\u2013 you\\u2019ve got to try it if you are ever in Singapore!\\n\\nIngredients You Need\\n--------------------\\n\\n*   **sesame oil** \\u2013 toasted sesame oil is a BIG pantry staple for me and we use this as a base oil in this recipe!\\n*   **hot bean paste** \\u2013 this is a secret ingredient for that flavour in mala xiang guo. Unfortunately, this paste is not gluten free.\\n*   **aromatics** \\u2013 garlic and ginger. You can omit garlic and substitute with hing if you are alliums free.\\n*   **chillies** \\u2013 you can customise the number of dried red chillies depending on the spice level you prefer. Medium spice calls for about 4-5 red chili peppers. \\n*   **shaoxing wine** \\u2013 you can substitute this with rice wine vinegar or regular white vinegar. \\n*   **spices** \\u2013 5-spice powder and ground sichuan pepper\\n*   **sauces** \\u2013 light and dark soy sauces \\n*   **vegetables** \\u2013 you can use any veggies you like but I added lotus root, bok choy, fried tofu, oyster mushrooms, beancurd skin and ramen noodles. \\n\\nThis sichuan-style mala stirfry is what dreams are made of \\u2013 packed with veggies, protein, and a whole lot of spice and numbingness for that authentic taste.\\n\\nPrep Time 5 minutes\\n\\nTotal Time 15 minutes\\n\\nCourse: Main Course\\n\\nCuisine: Chinese\\n\\nKeyword: chinese, noodles\\n\\nServings: 2\\n\\n*   2 tbsp sesame oil\\n*   2 tbsp hot bean paste\\n*   1 tsp minced ginger\\n*   2 cloves garlic\\n*   4-5 dried red chillies deseeded\\n*   2 tbsp peanuts\\n*   1.5 tbsp shaoxing wine\\n*   1.5 tbsp light soy sauce\\n*   1 tsp 5-spice powder\\n*   1 tsp sichuan pepper\\n*   1/2 tbsp dark soy sauce\\n\\n#### Toppings\\n\\n*   8-10 slices lotus root\\n*   4 bunches bok choy\\n*   150 g extra firm tofu\\n*   150 g oyster mushrooms\\n*   beancurd skin\\n*   2 stalks scallions\\n*   1 serving ramen\\n\\n#### Garnish\\n\\n*   toasted sesame seeds\\n*   chopped cilantro \\n*   chili sesame oil\\n*   1 serving rice for sharing\\n\\n*   Cube tofu and pan fry in olive oil until crispy. Meanwhile heat up some water in a pot, and blanch your greens for a minute, followed by ingredients that take longer to cook like mushrooms and lotus root (2-3 minutes). Take them out.\\n\\n*   Boil your ramen noodles according to package instructions with that same water. Drain and keep the water.\\n\\n*   To a wok, add sesame oil. Add deseeded red chillies, sliced garlic and saute for a few seconds. Add peanuts and saute for a minute. Add ginger paste and saute for a few seconds.\\n\\n*   Add hot bean paste, shaoxing wine, soy sauces, 5-spice and sichuan pepper. Mix well and add some of the noodle water to loosen the sauce.\\n\\n*   Let the spices cook for a minute. Add in your mushrooms, lotus root, beancurd skin and chopped scallions. Give it a good mix.\\n\\n*   Then add ramen, fried tofu and blanched bok choy. Toss and give that a good mix.\\n\\n*   Serve with toasted sesame seeds and cilantro.

(well, almost neighbors as I\'m in the county). I\'ve been watching some of your videos to get ideas because I love \\u5ddd\\u83dc and just today found out you were in this area. I\'ve been making my own Sichuan food since there are so few decent restaurants here. I lived in China for over ten years and was lucky enough to have an ayi from Sichuan who taught me how to cook some Sichuan food. I love your recipes! I would love to see your version of \\u9e21\\u4e1d\\u51c9\\u9762, I have tried making it many times and while I like the results, mine never quite seems the same as what I ate in China.\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\n Like \\n\\n 1 \\n\\n Dislike \\n\\nReply\\n\\n![Image 22: Yi\'s Sichuan Kitchen](https://yt3.ggpht.com/Fpt5sXlJ31FPIx4MNh4Y8lw_6EV-aRjGenArpx5wP3m-lfSrLypnMazAfRs-uTyhL63JsDEVBg=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj)\\n\\n\\u00b7\\n\\n1 reply\\n\\n![Image 23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN8CEeztrks&pp=ygUJI21hbGFkaXNo)\\n\\n\\u00b7\\n\\n1 reply\\n\\n![Image 24](https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_nniQSLKbshAC6b1vX4-8WjJul0wOK82FWPkEj9LCmD0n-p=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj)\\n\\n### [@sulecuber](https://www.youtube.com/@sulecuber)\\n\\n[1 year ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN8CEeztrks&lc=UgyUyhzLzZdaNVR8NeB4AaABAg)\\n\\nLove from Myanmar \\ud83c\\uddf2\\ud83c\\uddf2\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\n Like \\n\\n 2 \\n\\n Dislike \\n\\n![Image 25](https://yt3.ggpht.com/Fpt5sXlJ31FPIx4MNh4Y8lw_6EV-aRjGenArpx5wP3m-lfSrLypnMazAfRs-uTyhL63JsDEVBg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj)\\n\\n \\u2764 by @YiSichuanKitchen \\n\\nReply\\n\\n1 reply\\n\\n1 reply\\n\\n![Image 26](https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_m_d5MOyJmjo1KYYV22iYZ4n38vILWQMp9BVt5NEGs=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj)\\n\\n### [@samlin6443](https://www.youtube.com/@samlin6443)\\n\\n[2 years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN8CEeztrks&lc=UgzojrODnd-Ap9LFkA94AaABAg)\\n\\nJust found this channel, gonna make this for dinner ![Image 27: \\ud83d\\ude0a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN8CEeztrks&pp=ygUJI21hbGFkaXNo)\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\n Like \\n\\n Dislike \\n\\n![Image 28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN8CEeztrks&pp=ygUJI21hbGFkaXNo)\\n\\n \\u2764 by @YiSichuanKitchen \\n\\nReply\\n\\n![Image 29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN8CEeztrks&pp=ygUJI21hbGFkaXNo)\\n\\n\\u00b7\\n\\n1 reply\\n\\n![Image 30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN8CEeztrks&pp=ygUJI21hbGFkaXNo)\\n\\n\\u00b7\\n\\n1 reply\\n\\n![Image 31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN8CEeztrks&pp=ygUJI21hbGFkaXNo)\\n\\n### [@Whale_Chum](https://www.youtube.com/@Whale_Chum)\\n\\n[3 years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN8CEeztrks&lc=Ugyc5fn8l7Onh1Cer514AaABAg)\\n\\nI\\u2019ll have to make some.

It\'s been a while and we had very snowy and cold winter in St. Louis! This winter I was trapped inside a lot because of the cold weather. So I wanted to make a dish that I craved when I felt a little blue and it is mala xiang guo. This mala xiang guo stir fry dish uses Haidilao spicy stir fry mix and you can create it with anything you have in your fridge in just 15 minutes! Just throw in the vegetables, tofu and meat and there you got it!! It\'s super easy and super satisfying :) If you like this video, make sure to give me a thumbs up so more people can see my videos! Follow my IG @YiSichuanKitchen Also do you have a go-to dish for cold weather and when you feel down? Let me know in the comment because I do believe food can heal our body and heart! Here is the ingredients: Beef meat ball (cut in half) Pork belly (sliced ) Lotus root (sliced) Potato (sliced) Celtuce (also called \\"stem lettuce\\" and wo sun in Chinese) Enoki mushroom Shiitake mushroom Bean curd (fuzhu, soak in water ) Green onion 4-5 Ginger 1 piece Garlic 7-8 Hotpot mix 1 bag Peppercorn 1 tbsp Dried chili a handful Hot water cook meat and veggies ingredients Add oil in wok, add ginger and garlic, add peppercorn and dried chili Add hot pot mix Add in meatball, pork belly Cooking wine Add in veggies Add salt if needed Top with green onion and sesame More recipes?

Dry pot may be hot pot\\u2019s soupless cousin, but don\\u2019t mistake this lack of soup for lack of flavor. Each bite comes with a wonderfully concentrated, tingly sensation from the spice oil, thanks to the Sichuan peppercorns and dried chiles, and a dash of sweetness from the Shaoxing wine. When looking for dried chiles for this recipe, seek out chao tian jiao, or facing heaven chiles. If you can\\u2019t find them, chiles de \\u00e1rbol are a good substitute. Do not use dried bird chiles here; their heat will overpower the fragrant parts of this fragrant dish.\\n\\nAll products featured on Epicurious are independently selected by our editors.

Make flax eggs by combining 4 tbsp flax meal with 12 tbsp water =\\u00bd cup. 2. Preheat the oven to 350\\u00b0F (175\\u00b0C). Cut Sunkist\\u00ae Navel Oranges into quarters. Sift your all-purpose flour. 3. Combine all ingredients required for the cake and blend on high for 30 to 45 seconds max. Over blending can cause the cake to become dense. 4. Grease a cake pan with olive oil or avocado oil spray. Pour the batter into the pan and bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. 5. Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. 6. Sift icing sugar on top and place sliced oranges.

Well, I\\u2019m going to call out a potential darkhorse dish which I hope will get it\\u2019s time on the podium soon - _Mala Dry Pot._\\n\\nNow, you may be thinking \\u201cWhat the heck is that, Phil?\\u201d - and I wouldn\\u2019t judge you. That\\u2019s because it seems to be a relatively niche dish at least here along the East Coast of the USA. I\\u2019ve only found it in 2 restaurants I\\u2019ve been to to date, and if you know how much I enjoy going to restaurants big and small, you know this dish must be a relatively rare thing. But I\\u2019ll let you in on a hint of what it is - you\\u2019ve probably heard of [Sichuan Hot Pot](https://thewoksoflife.com/hot-pot/), right? Those bubbling cauldrons of spicy, red-tinged and oil slicked broth where people are dunking in thin slices of meat, seafood, and vegetables and dipping them in all types of sauces? Well Mala Dry Pot is Hot Pot\\u2019s more assertive, bolder cousin - you know, the one that has a motorbike, enjoys wearing a leather jacket with a sherpa collar, and will go up to anyone at a bar and chat them up? That guy.\\n\\n_Anywho_ - Mala Dry Pot is a truly superior dish not only because it\\u2019s arguably event tastier than the more known Mala Hot Pot, but also because it\\u2019s easier to make and requires much less clean up and prep. If you\\u2019re a fan of spicy, savory food that will make you come back craving more, this one\\u2019s for you.\\n\\n_Let\\u2019s dive in._\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n**What is Chinese Mala Dry Pot?**So you may be thinking _\\"why is this dish a dark horse?\\"_ Well, aside from being relatively not well known at least in most parts of the USA, it has all the makings of a hype worthy dish. It\\u2019s full of bold flavor, it\'s infinitely customizable, it\'s very photogenic, and it\\u2019s made to be shared by a group - so you know it will be perfect for TikTokers to monologue over in a video. Once it starts gaining visibility as hot pot has, I expect it to enter the cultural zeitgeist in no time.\\n\\nSo what is Mala Dry Pot? To sum it up, it\\u2019s a spicy, savory, and very saucy stir fry at its heart. The \\u201cdry\\u201d of Mala Dry Pot comes from the fact that it\\u2019s not served in or with a full pot of broth like it\\u2019s cousin Sihuan hot pot is. While the mix of spices and flavors can vary, my preference, and how I\\u2019ve seen dry pot usually prepared, is choosing, prepping, and pre-cooking a mix of vegetables and proteins and quickly stir frying it with a sauce featuring a lively mix of spices, aromatics, soy and chili sauces, and fresh herbs to create a extremely fragrant, spicy, and tingly dish.\\n\\nThe core flavors of Mala dishes - szechuan peppercorn, chilis, cumin, star anise, and more feature right up front in Mala Dry Pot. These provide the robust base flavors while fresh herbs and vegetables act as the foil to bring brightness and balance. Honestly, it\\u2019s hard to describe in words, so please trust me when I say it\\u2019s a flavor I sometimes dream about.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n![Image 2: Picture](https://www.suitandapron.com/uploads/3/7/2/1/37213807/published/20221113-192718.jpg?1676238327)\\n\\nPrepping for Mala Dry Pot\\n\\nNow that I\\u2019ve hopefully sold you on giving this dish a try, there are a few steps in the lead up and prep for making dry pot. Here\\u2019s a few tips to start:\\n\\nBalance flavor and texture when picking your protein and vegetables - Remember, we eat with all our senses, so when picking what meat and proteins you want to include, get a variety of colors, textures, and flavors to really make it your own. I recommend selecting 2-3 proteins and at least 2-3 core vegetables for dry pot - that way you can enjoy mixing and matching bites.\\n\\n*   _Example Proteins:_\\n    *   Thinly sliced steak (use more tender cuts like sirloin or filet)\\n    *   Sliced chicken\\n    *   Spam\\n    *   Fried tofu (Unfried tofu may break apart)\\n    *   Shrimp\\n    *   Fish cakes or balls\\n\\n*   _Example Vegetables:_\\n    *   Bok choy\\n    *   Enoki or sliced shiitake mushrooms\\n    *   Chinese broccoli\\n    *   Bean sprouts\\n    *   Carrots\\n    *   Bamboo shoots\\n    *   Napa cabbage\\n    *   Lotus root\\n\\n*   _Other Ideas:_\\n    *   Mini dumplings or wontons\\n    *   Rice cakes\\n    *   Rice noodles\\n\\nPre-Cutting and Cooking your Ingredients - This is a critical step in making mala dry pot and helps make sure things go smoothly once you get to the final stages of cooking.\\n\\n*   _Make sure your pieces are all cut into large but bite-sized pieces_ - You don\\u2019t need something that is very small here. Cut your proteins and veg into pieces that are hearty, without making you have to unhinge your jaw\\n*   _Cook ingredients individually and have them set aside at the ready to go_ - The method you use here can vary, but I tend to like to brown and stir fry meats and hearty vegetables like carrots in oil until just cooked on the outside, and blanche leafy vegetables like bok choy until crisp-tender in a pot of salted boiling water. It\\u2019s ok if they cool down while you prep the other ingredients, you will heat them up again in the final stir fry with the sauce.\\n*   _Measure out your spices and sauces ahead of time_ - At the very end of cooking, you will be making the sauce for your dry pot and it will come together relatively quickly, so you don\\u2019t want to be fumbling around in the depths of your spice cabinet looking for cumin or bay leaves while your other spices are starting to burn. Pre-measure your spices and put them into a small dish and do the same with your liquid sauces. You can always adjust more later if you want more heat or salt or sugar. Also feel free to adjust your level of spice - add or reduce the amount of chili to your taste buds - no judgment here.\\n*   _Don\\u2019t skip on the fresh herbs_ - What takes Mala Dry Pot from A-Tier to S-Tier is the final topping of fresh herbs. Cilantro is traditional and preferred here, but fresh green onion is also wonderful and thai basil could also be a fun twist.\\n\\nHave Lots of Rice - Make more than you think you will need - I\\u2019m just going to leave it at that.\\n\\nAlright - well you\\u2019ve heard enough from me - here\\u2019s my recipe for a Mala Dry Pot. Again, my choice of meats and vegetables were purely based on what I was craving at the time, but I encourage you to create your own mix.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\nRecipe: Chinese Mala Dry Pot\\n\\nServes: 2-3\\n\\nIngredients:\\n\\n*   1/2 Can of Spam, sliced into bite-sized pieces\\n*   10-12 oz. Steak, sirloin or strip recommended, cut into bite-sized pieces\\n*   1 Large carrot, sliced thin into bite sized pieces\\n*   5-6 Napa cabbage leaves, cut into large pieces\\n*   2-3 Shanghai or Baby Bok Choy - Cut into fourths, leaving the base attached\\n*   1 Package sliced shiitake mushrooms - About 4 Oz (or substitute enoki mushrooms)\\n*   3-4 Cloves garlic, roughly chopped\\n*   1-inch Piece of ginger, roughly chopped\\n*   Handful of Cilantro, roughly chopped\\n*   1 tsp Sesame seeds\\n*   Vegetable Oil\\n\\nSauce and Spices:\\n\\n*   2 tsp Ground cumin\\n*   1 tsp Five spice\\n*   1-2 tsp Szechuan peppercorns, crushed between your fingertips until fragrant\\n*   1/2 - 3/4 tsp Szechuan or red pepper flakes\\n*   2 Bay leaves\\n*   2 Whole star anise\\n*   1 Tbl Light Soy Sauce\\n*   1 Tsp Dark Soy Sauce\\n*   1 Tbl White sugar\\n*   1 tsp Chinese black vinegar (substitute balsamic if needed)\\n*   1 tsp Shaoxing cooking wine (Substitute dry sherry if needed)\\n*   2 tsp. Spicy Chili Crisp\\n*   1 generous tsp Chili Bean Sauce (AKA [Touban Jian or Doubanjiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubanjiang))\\n*   Vegetable Oil\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\n1.   Prepare your meats and vegetables by slicing them into large, bite-sized pieces. Set aside until ready to cook\\n2.   Combine your dry spices on a small plate or bowl, and combine your sauces except for the chili-bean paste in a separate bowl. Set aside until ready to cook\\n3.   In a large pan, heat up a thin layer of oil and brown your proteins until just cooked and taking on brown color on the outside - set aside\\n4.   Cook your firm vegetables, like carrots, in the same pan until just starting to get tender, about 2-3 minutes - set aside\\n5.   Cook your mushrooms until they have released their liquids and are soft - about 3-5 minutes - set aside\\n6.   In a large pot of boiling salted water, quickly blanche your napa cabbage and bok choy for 1-2 minutes until cooked but still crisp - remove from the water and set aside\\n7.   Once all main proteins and vegetables are prepared, return the large pan over medium-low heat. Add about 3 tablespoons of oil to the pan and add the dry spices, garlic, and ginger. Stir until spices are fragrant - about 1 minute.\\n8.   Add the chili bean paste and stir into the oil mixture - cook 1-minute more until fragrant\\n9.   Add the remaining sauce ingredients, raise the heat to medium, and bring to a boil\\n10.   Turn heat to medium-high and add all the prepped proteins and vegetables back into the pan. Stir to coat all the ingredients in the sauce and let the sauce start to thicken and glaze everything - 2-3 minutes. Taste and adjust the dish as needed with salt, sugar, or chili to taste. If the sauce is too loose, you can thicken it with a cornstarch slurry.\\n11.   Remove the pan from the heat and dish onto a large serving dish or platter - sprinkle generously with fresh chopped cilantro and a sprinkle of sesame seeds\\n12.   Serve family style with lots of rice and enjoy\\n\\nLet me know if you enjoyed trying this out in the comments below. _**Cheers!**_\\n\\n![Image 3](https://www.suitandapron.com/uploads/3/7/2/1/37213807/20221113-183652_orig.jpg)Suit and Apron -------------- No celebrity chef got to the top without getting burned, cut, and spilled on at least a couple dozen times.

It is a steamed stodgy cake made with rice flour and mooli/daikon. Usually seen or served pan fried in slices. This cake is a Cantonese favourite for Chinese new year and is available in all Cantonese dim sum restaurants all year round. This fried cake in dim sum restaurant normally looks pure white and quite plain with few minute pieces of Chinese sausage etc, the seasoning is usually msg, salt and some sugar. Homemade lo bak goh usually without msg and contains more \\u6599 \'lieu\' or added ingredients, also the adding of soy sauce can make the cake looks not as white as those in restaurant. Chinese \'wax\' meat or preserved meat like lap cheong (sausage) or lap yuk (bacon), minced pork, dried shrimps or dried scallops are common ingredients added for flavour and texture.\\n\\n[![Image 2](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVO1iaukuvpJOnh9F31MZTIxgG2HLwJEPGJeOe-_OZCCC-ZPVgTs9rA8EyPdiIxQYxEMeNnnJ13iBzTi7T0KiPzmbn3v8NL3G9Lv-MZzN1pNvaMN7c7uzmtrnHumwm_ToOzfVwHbV83uLC/s400/DSC02135.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVO1iaukuvpJOnh9F31MZTIxgG2HLwJEPGJeOe-_OZCCC-ZPVgTs9rA8EyPdiIxQYxEMeNnnJ13iBzTi7T0KiPzmbn3v8NL3G9Lv-MZzN1pNvaMN7c7uzmtrnHumwm_ToOzfVwHbV83uLC/s1600-h/DSC02135.jpg)\\n\\nHere is how I normally make this savoury cake.\\n\\nIngredients:\\n\\n2 - 2.5 stick lap cheong (chinese sausage)\\n\\n100g skinless lap yuk (chinese bacon) or 100 -125g minced pork\\n\\n2 tbsp dried shrimps, soaked\\n\\nabout 3 dried shitake mushroom (about 10g), soaked removed stalk\\n\\n2 dried scallop, soaked and shredded (optional)\\n\\n2 - 3 walnut size shallots\\n\\n2 decent size clove garlic\\n\\npinch of ground pepper\\n\\n0.5 - 1 tsp salt or to taste\\n\\n1 - 2 tsp light soy sauce\\n\\nabout 750 - 800g peeled mooli or daikon\\n\\nabout 250ml water (can use the soaking water for dried shrimps and dried scallop to replace this water)\\n\\n280g rice flour\\n\\n50g tapioca starch or potato starch\\n\\n300ml room temp. homemade chicken stock (or water with added chicken stock granules about 1 heap tsp)\\n\\n1 tsp sesame oil\\n\\ncooking oil\\n\\nMethod:\\n\\n1.   Soak the lap cheong and lap yuk (if using) in boiling liquid for few minutes till soften then finely chopped. \\n2.   Finely chopped garlic, shallot, soaked mushrooms and dried shrimps. \\n3.   Grate mooli/daikon. I used the food processor grater, saves a lot of work. For a very fine cake texture and save cooking time can also puree the mooli using the food processor.\\n\\n4.   Mix rice flour, starch, sesame oil and stock together.\\n\\n5.   Heat wok with few tbsp oil and fry shallot and garlic till soften. Then add sausage, bacon (or minced pork), dried shrimps, mushroom and scallop (if using). Fry till fragrant, and make sure meat does not clump together then add remaining seasoning ingredients. Remove to one side. Check if the wok has any brown sticky bits, if yes wash before proceeding to next step. Browning bits can make the cake looks greyish or brownish.\\n\\n6.   Stir fry mooli with a little oil for about 2 minutes then add 250ml water and cook for few minutes till the mooli is softened.\\n\\n7.   Stir in flour mixture, taste to check if more seasoning is needed and cook at low heat stirring all the time for till the mixture started to thicken like runny porridge before it gets too thick heat off.\\n\\n8.   Grease a large casserole dish or non loose base aluminium baking tin or 2 - 3 disposable foil oblong/round containers. Pour cake mixture into dish/container, smooth the top with dampen fingers lightly touching the surface. Ready for steaming. For one large cake this will take about 1.5 hour, for a smaller cake about 1 hour. Test with a skewer into the centre to see there is no whitish paste to ensure it is thoroughly cooked through. Once cooked, take the cake out cover loosely and leave to cool. If without a large enough steamer can cook the cake in the oven using a water bath (large roasting tray filled with some boiling water) covered with foil.\\n\\n9.   Can be eaten while warm as it is or cut into slices when cooled and fry with a little oil till both sides are golden brown. It is much easier to slice if the cake is cooled in the fridge for few hours or overnight.\\n\\nServe the cake with or without frying with [Cantonese chilli oil](http://sunflower-recipes.blogspot.com/2009/07/cantonese-hong-kong-style-chilli-oil.html), XO sauce, soy sauce or any favourite chilli sauce.\\n\\nThis cake will keep in the fridge for 4 - 5 days or frozen in chunk. If frozen, defrost before frying.\\n\\n17 Feb 2010\\n\\nAttached is a picture from [PlumLeaf](http://alittlebitofplumleaf.blogspot.com/) who has followed this recipe.

The dish features a medley of vegetables, tofu, meat, and seafood stir fried in a very rich and savory spicy sauce. It is often served in a giant bowl and shared family style over steamed rice.\\n\\nThe sauce is truly the highlight of the dish because it brings all the ingredients together and tastes addictively good. Every restaurant has their own secret sauce. But they share some common characteristics \\u2013 they\\u2019re all numbing, spicy, fragrant, rich and balanced.\\n\\nMa La Xiang Guo originated in Chongqing and became very popular in China in the early 2000s. I remember thousands of Mala Dry Pot restaurants popping up, one on every corner. And it soon became one of my favorite destinations to grab dinner and a beer with colleagues after work.\\n\\n![Image 2: Homemade mala dry pot in a pan](https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/220120_Mala-Dry-Pot-Mala-Xiang-Guo_4.jpg)\\nHow Ma La Xiang Guo is traditionally served\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you walk into a Ma La Xiang Guo restaurant in China, it might remind you of Chipotle. You will see arrays of ingredients neatly organized behind a counter covered with glass. To order, simply point out the ingredients you want in your pot. The waitress will start to add them into two big bowls, with vegetables and tofu in one and meat and seafood in the other. The price of the dish is measured by the weight. And you will choose the spice level you want \\u2013 non-spicy, mild, medium, very spicy, or super spicy. Once it\\u2019s cooked, a giant bowl will be served in the center of the table, to share family style.\\n\\nMa La Xiang Guo is getting quite popular in the US these days too, and I\\u2019ve tried it at some very good restaurants in New York. One of my favorites is [Mala Project](https://www.malaproject.nyc/menus), a slightly upscale restaurant that serves authentic dry pot in a chic ambience. I also happened to find a gem, [LaoMa Spicy](https://laomaspicyny.com/), a more toned-down place near NYU. They serve Ma La Xiang Guo the traditional way and it is a bit cheaper.\\n\\n![Image 3: Homemade Ma La Xiang Guo in a pan](https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/220120_Mala-Dry-Pot-Mala-Xiang-Guo_1.jpg)\\nWhat ingredients are used in Ma La Xiang Guo\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou can pretty much use any ingredients you want and still make a great Ma La Xiang Guo. The key is to select various ingredients that have different textures and tastes, so the final dish is more balanced and fun to eat.\\n\\nSome of my favorite vegetarian ingredients include various [Chinese greens](https://omnivorescookbook.com/chinese-greens/), assorted mushrooms, things that add texture such as bamboo shoots and wood ear mushrooms, and [tofu products](https://omnivorescookbook.com/tofu-in-chinese-cooking/).\\n\\nFor the meat / seafood part, my guilty pleasure is grilled chicken wings and Spam. I also like to add sliced fish or fish balls into my dry pot.\\n\\nIn China (and at very authentic restaurants in the US), you will find Ma La Xiang Guo menus offering a lot of innards. Ingredients such as chicken gizzard, beef tripe and tongue, and pork liver are commonly used and very popular.\\n\\nWhy this recipe\\n---------------\\n\\nMaking a great Ma La Xiang Guo is quite straightforward yet slightly tricky. You will need to:\\n\\n1.   Cook a super flavorful sauce that is aromatic and rich in flavor\\n2.   Prepare the ingredients separately so each one gets cooked to the perfect degree\\n3.   Stir fry everything together with the sauce in a pan that\\u2019s big enough\\n\\nThe biggest challenge is to make a great sauce without using 20 ingredients. And to stir fry so many ingredients together without overcooking any of them.\\n\\nAfter a lot of research and testing, I found out the great solutions to solve these problems:\\n\\n1.   Use a good hot pot base as the main ingredient, then add doubanjiang and black bean sauce to **make the most flavorful sauce with only 3 ingredients.**\\n2.   Blanch the ingredients in groups instead of stir frying separately, so **it\\u2019s fast and easy to prepare, plus you will use less oil in the final dish.**\\n3.   Toss all the blanched ingredients together at the end with the sauce in a big pan. So**you will be able to make this dish without using a wok.**\\n\\nBest Ma La Xiang Guo Sauce\\n--------------------------\\n\\nThe easiest way to create a great Ma La Xiang Guo sauce is to select a solid hot pot base, then add my two secret ingredients.\\n\\n### The hot pot base\\n\\nFor the hot pot base, I used [Hai Di Lao Sichuan Spicy Hot Pot Base](https://amzn.to/41Z4wWj). Hai Di Lao is the most popular hot pot chain in China and their product quality is very good. Their spicy hot pot base is rich, but not too intense like some tallow-based ones. This brand is also quite easy to find in various Asian grocery stores and [on Amazon](https://amzn.to/41Z4wWj).\\n\\nIf you really want to make things from scratch, you can use my [homemade Sichuan Spicy Hot Pot Base](https://omnivorescookbook.com/sichuan-hot-pot-soup-base/). It contains less additives and no MSG.\\n\\n### Secret ingredients\\n\\nI added [Doubanjiang](http://amzn.to/2waIMbh) and [Homemade Black Bean Sauce](https://omnivorescookbook.com/homemade-black-bean-sauce/) to the hot pot base. The result was amazing and truly like the dry pot you get at a restaurant! If you do not have homemade black bean sauce, a store-bought one works as well.\\n\\nMany Ma La Xiang Guo recipes use a lot of spices to make the dish more fragrant. However, if you use a good hot pot base, it should already be fragrant enough. I find this shortcut makes cooking extremely easy and the result outstanding.\\n\\nMy choice of ingredients and how to prepare them\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe fun part of Ma La Xiang Guo is the variety of ingredients. I went a bit overboard in this recipe and used nine ingredients by separating them into seven groups. I prefer to use one or two ingredients from each group for texture, but it\\u2019s totally up to you to add or reduce the variety.\\n\\nThis recipe requires the right amount of ingredients so your largest pan can hold them, and they will work perfectly with the sauce ratio. That\\u2019s why I created a list below, using cups and weight, to help you choose and swap out ingredients.\\n\\nIf you prefer not to use certain ingredients, you can replace them with different ones. For example, use more leafy greens and skip the mushrooms.\\n\\n![Image 4: Ingredients for making Ma La Xiang Guo](https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/220120_Mala-Dry-Pot-Mala-Xiang-Guo_7.jpg)\\n### How to make this dish vegetarian / vegan\\n\\nTo make a vegetarian or vegan Ma La Xiang Guo, simply skip the meat and replace it with some other ingredients you prefer. I highly recommend using a variety of [tofu products](https://omnivorescookbook.com/tofu-in-chinese-cooking/) if you can find them. For example, yuba sheets or yuba knots, tofu skin, fried tofu and smoked tofu. They add great texture and taste to the dish.\\n\\n### How to prepare the ingredients\\n\\nI\\u2019ve tried stir frying ingredients separately and blanching them, and finally landed on blanching except for the meat and seafood. Since you will be using a super strong sauce, the vegetables will be flavorful enough without stir frying them individually. This streamlines and simplifies the process a lot. Plus you will consume a bit less oil at the end.\\n\\nFor the meat and seafood, I do find that pan searing tastes much better. For fattier and higher quality meat, such as ribeye steak, chicken thighs, and shrimp, you can simply sear the meat. If using lean meat such as chicken breast, flank steak, or fish, I prefer to marinate them in a bit of Shaoxing wine and cornstarch so they will stay tender and juicy.\\n\\n### The formula to make Ma La Xiang Guo with any ingredient you have\\n\\n| AMOUNT | INGREDIENTS | COOKING METHOD |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| 2 oz (1/2 cup, 50 g) | 1 tofu ingredient (tofu sheets, yuba, fried tofu) | blanch for 1 minute |\\n| 4 oz (2 cups, 110 g) | 1 leafy green (napa cabbage, bok choy, yu choy) | blanch for 1 minute |\\n| 6 oz (1 1/2 cups, 220 g) | 2 mushrooms (enoki , wood ear, oyster, king oyster) | blanch for 1 minute |\\n| 2 oz (1/2 cup, 50 g) | 1 starchy tuber (lotus root, potato, taro) | blanch for 2 to 3 minutes |\\n| 6 oz (2 cups, 220 g) | 1 crunchy vegetable (cauliflower, broccoli, celtuce) | blanch for 2 to 3 minutes, except celtuce which does not require blanching |\\n| 8 oz (220 g) | 1 to 2 meats/seafood (shrimp, thinly sliced pork belly, sliced beef steak, chicken thigh, cooked chicken wings*) | pan searing |\\n| 2 oz (1/2 cup, 50 g) | fun stuff (boiled and peeled quail eggs, bamboo shoots, fish balls, fish cakes, spam, sweet potato noodles, rice cakes, corn) | blanched accordingly; for Spam, pan fry until crispy; pre-soak dried noodles |\\n\\nTo sum up, you should use about 6 to 7 cups of vegetables, and half a pound (225 g) of meat in total.\\n\\nHow to cook Ma La Xiang Guo\\n---------------------------\\n\\nThe process for cooking Ma La Xiang Guo is super easy.\\n\\n1.   Blanch the veggie group that needs more cooking time\\n2.   Blanch the tender veggies \\u2013 some just need a very quick blanch\\n3.   Sear the meat\\n4.   Sear the seafood\\n5.   Saute aromatics\\n6.   Briefly cook the sauce base\\n7.   Coat the blanched vegetables and tofu with sauce\\n8.   Mix in the cooked meat and seafood\\n9.   Stir in the cilantro\\n\\nThat\\u2019s it!\\n\\nThe recipe looks a bit long but the process is quite straightforward. The result is so rewarding and tastes just like the restaurant version. You simply need to make some steamed rice and you\\u2019ll have a super delicious meal for four.\\n\\n![Image 5: How to make Ma La Xiang Guo step-by-step](https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/220120_Mala-Dry-Pot-Mala-Xiang-Guo_8.jpg)![Image 6: Mala dry pot close up](https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/220120_Mala-Dry-Pot-Mala-Xiang-Guo_5.jpg)\\nAfterthought\\n------------\\n\\nThe beauty of Ma La Xiang Guo is, you can use pretty much any ingredients you like and the result is always good.

Then blanch the bok choy, enoki mushrooms and wood ear mushrooms for 30 seconds to 1 minute, until just starting to turn soft.\\n\\n*   To cook the mala dry pot: Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Spread the thinly sliced steak without overlapping. Cook for 30 seconds or until the bottom turns light golden. Flip and sear on the other side until just cooked through and the inside of the meat is still slightly pink. Transfer the meat to a plate.\\n\\n*   Add the shrimp to the pan. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until the surface turns pink-ish white. Flip and cook on the other side for another 1 to 2 minutes until the shrimp has fully curled up. Transfer to a plate with the steak.\\n\\n*   Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pan and the garlic, ginger, and chili peppers. Fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\\n\\n*   Pour in the sauce. Cook for another 30 seconds, or until the hot pot base is fully melted.\\n\\n*   Add the blanched ingredients. Toss a few times to coat well. Add the stir fried steak and shrimp. Toss until everything is evenly coated. Add the cilantro and give it one more toss. Immediately transfer everything to a large bowl or plate.\\n\\n*   Serve hot family-style as a main dish with steamed rice.\\n\\n[Ingredient Substitution Guide](https://omnivorescookbook.com/ingredient-substitutions-for-chinese-cooking/)\\n\\n1.   If using raw lotus root, blanch for 3 minutes according to the recipe. If using pre-sliced and boiled lotus root, skip the blanching.\\n2.   If you use premium cuts of beef, chicken thigh and / or shrimp, sear them directly. For leaner cuts such as chicken breast, beef flank steak, and fish, mix every 4 oz. with 1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine and 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch to keep the meat juicy and tender.\\n3.   Meat ingredients can be blanched but will be less flavorful. Any other ingredient can also be individually stir fried, but for ease and speed of the recipe it\\u2019s best to blanch the non-meat ingredients.\\n\\nServing: 1 serving, Calories: 339 kcal, Carbohydrates: 11.1 g, Protein: 15.5 g, Fat: 27 g, Saturated Fat: 4.5 g, Cholesterol: 84 mg, Sodium: 512 mg, Potassium: 393 mg, Fiber: 1.5 g, Sugar: 1.7 g, Calcium: 129 mg, Iron: 5 mg\\n\\n**Have a question or feedback?**[Add a Comment](https://omnivorescookbook.com/ma-la-xiang-guo#comments)\\n\\n**Did you make this?** I want to see!

Please read our [disclosure policy.](https://whattocooktoday.com/disclosure-and-privacy-policy)_\\n\\n**If you love spicy numbing food, then you need to meet ma la xiang guo. It is spicy and numbing, yet you can\\u2019t stop eating it. I\\u2019m sharing how you can easily make ma la xiang guo at home using hai di lao mala sauce and also how you can make your own mala sauce if you choose to.**\\n\\n![Image 1: Easy Ma La Xiang Guo At Home (Spicy Numbing Stir-fry)](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-8.jpg)\\n\\n I remember a few years ago when we were visiting Chicago, my husband found this Sichuan restaurant and we were craving spicy food then and I immediately ordered ma la xiang guo. The portion was HUGE! I mean, HUGE! It was filled with TONS of seafood and meat and oh gosh\\u2026lots of Sichuan peppercorns and the super spicy ma la sauce. I considered myself a person who can really eat spicy food and this ma la xiang guo was off the chart spicy! LOL AND numbing! but we loved it so much!\\n\\n Spicy ma la food sure has caught its trend in Singapore or I should say, outside of China, in recent years. From the spicy mala hot pot and now the dry version of hot pot, the ma la xiang guo! When you eat ma la xiang guo in restaurants, you picked your ingredients, they will weigh them on the scale (yup!) and the cook will fry up ma la xian guo using what you picked! It can cost you quite a bit. I think ma la xiang guo made at home is just as delicious, and the nice thing about it is that, you can use whatever ingredients you have leftover or you can go all out and put in whatever you fancy.\\n\\n**Easy Homemade Ma la Sauce vs Hai Di Lau Ma la sauce**\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf this is your first time making ma la xiang guo, I suggest using the [Hai Di Lau ma la basic stir-fry sauce](https://amzn.to/3dTUko3) (not sponsored). It\\u2019s just so much more convenient and it gives you that satisfying level of spiciness and numbness. I actually use the Hai Di Lau ma la hotpot sauce that I purchased for making hotpot but didn\\u2019t end up using it. They are very similar. You are of course, welcome to use whatever ma la stir-fry sauce you like, you don\\u2019t have to use this brand. For homemade ma la sauce I\\u2019ve tried using [Lao Gan Ma chili crisp in oil](https://amzn.to/3yOLtfv) and then add some Szechuan peppercorns and some seasonings and it actually turns out pretty good too.\\n\\n![Image 2: Easy Ma La Xiang Guo At Home (Spicy Numbing Stir-fry)](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-9.jpg)\\n\\n### MY LATEST VIDEOS\\n\\nnext\\n\\nstay\\n\\nCC\\n\\nSettings Off Arabic Chinese English French German Hindi Portuguese Spanish\\n\\nFont Color white Font Opacity 100%Font Size 100%Font Family Arial Text Shadow none Background Color black Background Opacity 50%Window Color black Window Opacity 0%\\n\\nWhite Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan\\n\\n100%75%50%25%\\n\\n200%175%150%125%100%75%50%\\n\\nArial Georgia Garamond Courier New Tahoma Times New Roman Trebuchet MS Verdana\\n\\nNone Raised Depressed Uniform Drop Shadow\\n\\nWhite Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan\\n\\n100%75%50%25%0%\\n\\nWhite Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan\\n\\n100%75%50%25%0%\\n\\n**Ingredients suitable for ma la xiang guo**\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou can use pretty much whatever your heart desires. Here are just some suggestions in case you need some ideas\\n\\n**1. Veggies**\\n\\n Veggies need to be bite-size or thinly sliced and usually blanched before stir-frying.\\n\\n You can use bok choy, cabbage, slices of carrots, baby corn, broccoli florets, shiitake mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, wood ear mushrooms, lotus roots, potato slices\\n\\n**2. Meat**\\n\\n Thinly sliced beef, chicken, pork, meatballs, luncheon meat (cut into cubes or slices), hot dogs (cut into cubes or slices)\\n\\n**3. Seafood**\\n\\n Shrimp, squid, fish cake slices, fish balls, surimi\\n\\n**4. Meatless protein**\\n\\n Beancurd sticks (soak until soft), extra-firm tofu (cut into cubes or slices), tempeh (cut into cubes or slices)\\n\\n**5. Noodles or carbs**\\n\\n Instant noodles, mung bean thread noodles, Korean sweet potato noodles, Chinese or Korean rice cakes\\n\\n**6. Low-carb options**\\n\\n Shirataki noodles, konnyaku jelly (cut into cubes)\\n\\n**How to cook easy ma la xiang guo at home**\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\n1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add cabbage, potatoes and lotus roots and blanch for about 1-2 minutes. Drain off water and refresh with cold water and set aside\\n\\n![Image 3](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-10.jpg)\\n\\n 2. Whatever noodles you use, cook them according to the instruction. I use instant ramen noodles. Don\\u2019t overcook the noodles\\n\\n![Image 4](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-1-1.jpg)\\n\\n 3. Preheat your skillet or wok. If you use ready-made ma la sauce, add about 3-4 Tbsp of the sauce, or in my case, I use 1/2 pack of Hai Di Lao ma la sauce. If you decide to do the homemade ma la sauce, add about 3 Tbsp of lao gan ma chili and Sichuan peppercorns. The amount is really up to your tolerance\\n\\n![Image 5](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-2.jpg)\\n\\n 4. Add the shrimp and stir fry until they just started to turn pink. If you use meat slices, add them here too. Add the fish cakes along with the blanched veggies, noodles and whole dried chilies. Add seasonings and stir to mix everything to make sure they are coated with the ma la sauce. Have a taste, at this point if you feel like you need more, you can add more of the ma la sauce. Turn off the heat\\n\\n![Image 6](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-4.jpg)\\n\\n 5. Add the toasted nuts, sesame seeds, green onion and give them a final toss to mix everything. Garnish with some fresh cilantro leaves. Serve immediately\\n\\n![Image 7](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-5.jpg)\\n\\nMa la xiang guo stir-fry is ready in no time \\ud83d\\ude42 My husband loves Sichuan peppercorns and so this dish is needless to say, one of his favorites.

Almost every hawker centre now has this stir fried dish where you can customise the vegetables, proteins and noodles that go in. You can also choose your spice level and add garnishes like cilantro and peanuts if you prefer. Overall, the customisation of the dish ensures anyone and everyone is able to enjoy it and no matter what it\\u2019s packed with flavour!\\n\\nAnd it\\u2019s not just the chillies that flavour this dish \\u2013 it also includes spices like garlic, sichuan pepper, 5-spice powder and most importantly, hot bean paste. It\\u2019s usually shared between 2 to even more than 6 people sometimes with a huge mega dry pot. It\\u2019s crazy how much people love eating Mala Xiang Guo as a social experience (myself included!)\\n\\nIn restaurants, there are so many delectable dishes to select from \\u2013 you can pick your choice of protein, different types of beancurd, and vegetables. There is really no right or wrong way to construct your bowl but generally if it\\u2019s just the two of us \\u2013 were pick around 4-5 dishes in a reasonable quantity.\\n\\n![Image 2](https://browngirlveganeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/photo1705849696-1.jpeg)\\n\\nI used to be so crazy about this dish once that I swore my future partner had to like this dish if not we were just not meant to be \\u2013 I got lucky that my partner loves it too ![Image 3: \\ud83d\\ude09](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/svg/1f609.svg) However, I always preferred to prepare this dish at home as it was much healthier than ones you find outside (sometimes it\\u2019s loaded with oils and you can\\u2019t really tell if it\\u2019s truly vegan unless it\\u2019s a vegetarian place). My favourite vegan mala dry pot has got to be Green On Earth, Rail Mall \\u2013 you\\u2019ve got to try it if you are ever in Singapore!\\n\\nIngredients You Need\\n--------------------\\n\\n*   **sesame oil** \\u2013 toasted sesame oil is a BIG pantry staple for me and we use this as a base oil in this recipe!\\n*   **hot bean paste** \\u2013 this is a secret ingredient for that flavour in mala xiang guo. Unfortunately, this paste is not gluten free.\\n*   **aromatics** \\u2013 garlic and ginger. You can omit garlic and substitute with hing if you are alliums free.\\n*   **chillies** \\u2013 you can customise the number of dried red chillies depending on the spice level you prefer. Medium spice calls for about 4-5 red chili peppers. \\n*   **shaoxing wine** \\u2013 you can substitute this with rice wine vinegar or regular white vinegar. \\n*   **spices** \\u2013 5-spice powder and ground sichuan pepper\\n*   **sauces** \\u2013 light and dark soy sauces \\n*   **vegetables** \\u2013 you can use any veggies you like but I added lotus root, bok choy, fried tofu, oyster mushrooms, beancurd skin and ramen noodles. \\n\\nThis sichuan-style mala stirfry is what dreams are made of \\u2013 packed with veggies, protein, and a whole lot of spice and numbingness for that authentic taste.\\n\\nPrep Time 5 minutes\\n\\nTotal Time 15 minutes\\n\\nCourse: Main Course\\n\\nCuisine: Chinese\\n\\nKeyword: chinese, noodles\\n\\nServings: 2\\n\\n*   2 tbsp sesame oil\\n*   2 tbsp hot bean paste\\n*   1 tsp minced ginger\\n*   2 cloves garlic\\n*   4-5 dried red chillies deseeded\\n*   2 tbsp peanuts\\n*   1.5 tbsp shaoxing wine\\n*   1.5 tbsp light soy sauce\\n*   1 tsp 5-spice powder\\n*   1 tsp sichuan pepper\\n*   1/2 tbsp dark soy sauce\\n\\n#### Toppings\\n\\n*   8-10 slices lotus root\\n*   4 bunches bok choy\\n*   150 g extra firm tofu\\n*   150 g oyster mushrooms\\n*   beancurd skin\\n*   2 stalks scallions\\n*   1 serving ramen\\n\\n#### Garnish\\n\\n*   toasted sesame seeds\\n*   chopped cilantro \\n*   chili sesame oil\\n*   1 serving rice for sharing\\n\\n*   Cube tofu and pan fry in olive oil until crispy. Meanwhile heat up some water in a pot, and blanch your greens for a minute, followed by ingredients that take longer to cook like mushrooms and lotus root (2-3 minutes). Take them out.\\n\\n*   Boil your ramen noodles according to package instructions with that same water. Drain and keep the water.\\n\\n*   To a wok, add sesame oil. Add deseeded red chillies, sliced garlic and saute for a few seconds. Add peanuts and saute for a minute. Add ginger paste and saute for a few seconds.\\n\\n*   Add hot bean paste, shaoxing wine, soy sauces, 5-spice and sichuan pepper. Mix well and add some of the noodle water to loosen the sauce.\\n\\n*   Let the spices cook for a minute. Add in your mushrooms, lotus root, beancurd skin and chopped scallions. Give it a good mix.\\n\\n*   Then add ramen, fried tofu and blanched bok choy. Toss and give that a good mix.\\n\\n*   Serve with toasted sesame seeds and cilantro. Enjoy!\\n\\nPost navigation\\n---------------"}, {"title": "Easiest Mala Xiang Guo Recipe Ready in 15 Min | \\u5730\\u9053\\u9ebb\\u8fa3\\u9999\\u9505", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN8CEeztrks&pp=ygUJI21hbGFkaXNo", "snippet": "Hi everyone!!

I lived in China for over ten years and was lucky enough to have an ayi from Sichuan who taught me how to cook some Sichuan food. I love your recipes! I would love to see your version of \\u9e21\\u4e1d\\u51c9\\u9762, I have tried making it many times and while I like the results, mine never quite seems the same as what I ate in China.\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\n Like \\n\\n 1 \\n\\n Dislike \\n\\nReply\\n\\n![Image 22: Yi\'s Sichuan Kitchen](https://yt3.ggpht.com/Fpt5sXlJ31FPIx4MNh4Y8lw_6EV-aRjGenArpx5wP3m-lfSrLypnMazAfRs-uTyhL63JsDEVBg=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj)\\n\\n\\u00b7\\n\\n1 reply\\n\\n![Image 23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN8CEeztrks&pp=ygUJI21hbGFkaXNo)\\n\\n\\u00b7\\n\\n1 reply\\n\\n![Image 24](https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_nniQSLKbshAC6b1vX4-8WjJul0wOK82FWPkEj9LCmD0n-p=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj)\\n\\n### [@sulecuber](https://www.youtube.com/@sulecuber)\\n\\n[1 year ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN8CEeztrks&lc=UgyUyhzLzZdaNVR8NeB4AaABAg)\\n\\nLove from Myanmar \\ud83c\\uddf2\\ud83c\\uddf2\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\n Like \\n\\n 2 \\n\\n Dislike \\n\\n![Image 25](https://yt3.ggpht.com/Fpt5sXlJ31FPIx4MNh4Y8lw_6EV-aRjGenArpx5wP3m-lfSrLypnMazAfRs-uTyhL63JsDEVBg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj)\\n\\n \\u2764 by @YiSichuanKitchen \\n\\nReply\\n\\n1 reply\\n\\n1 reply\\n\\n![Image 26](https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_m_d5MOyJmjo1KYYV22iYZ4n38vILWQMp9BVt5NEGs=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj)\\n\\n### [@samlin6443](https://www.youtube.com/@samlin6443)\\n\\n[2 years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN8CEeztrks&lc=UgzojrODnd-Ap9LFkA94AaABAg)\\n\\nJust found this channel, gonna make this for dinner ![Image 27: \\ud83d\\ude0a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN8CEeztrks&pp=ygUJI21hbGFkaXNo)\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\n Like \\n\\n Dislike \\n\\n![Image 28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN8CEeztrks&pp=ygUJI21hbGFkaXNo)\\n\\n \\u2764 by @YiSichuanKitchen \\n\\nReply\\n\\n![Image 29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN8CEeztrks&pp=ygUJI21hbGFkaXNo)\\n\\n\\u00b7\\n\\n1 reply\\n\\n![Image 30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN8CEeztrks&pp=ygUJI21hbGFkaXNo)\\n\\n\\u00b7\\n\\n1 reply\\n\\n![Image 31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN8CEeztrks&pp=ygUJI21hbGFkaXNo)\\n\\n### [@Whale_Chum](https://www.youtube.com/@Whale_Chum)\\n\\n[3 years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN8CEeztrks&lc=Ugyc5fn8l7Onh1Cer514AaABAg)\\n\\nI\\u2019ll have to make some.

It\'s been a while and we had very snowy and cold winter in St. Louis! This winter I was trapped inside a lot because of the cold weather. So I wanted to make a dish that I craved when I felt a little blue and it is mala xiang guo. This mala xiang guo stir fry dish uses Haidilao spicy stir fry mix and you can create it with anything you have in your fridge in just 15 minutes! Just throw in the vegetables, tofu and meat and there you got it!! It\'s super easy and super satisfying :) If you like this video, make sure to give me a thumbs up so more people can see my videos! Follow my IG @YiSichuanKitchen Also do you have a go-to dish for cold weather and when you feel down? Let me know in the comment because I do believe food can heal our body and heart! Here is the ingredients: Beef meat ball (cut in half) Pork belly (sliced ) Lotus root (sliced) Potato (sliced) Celtuce (also called \\"stem lettuce\\" and wo sun in Chinese) Enoki mushroom Shiitake mushroom Bean curd (fuzhu, soak in water ) Green onion 4-5 Ginger 1 piece Garlic 7-8 Hotpot mix 1 bag Peppercorn 1 tbsp Dried chili a handful Hot water cook meat and veggies ingredients Add oil in wok, add ginger and garlic, add peppercorn and dried chili Add hot pot mix Add in meatball, pork belly Cooking wine Add in veggies Add salt if needed Top with green onion and sesame More recipes?

Dry pot may be hot pot\\u2019s soupless cousin, but don\\u2019t mistake this lack of soup for lack of flavor. Each bite comes with a wonderfully concentrated, tingly sensation from the spice oil, thanks to the Sichuan peppercorns and dried chiles, and a dash of sweetness from the Shaoxing wine. When looking for dried chiles for this recipe, seek out chao tian jiao, or facing heaven chiles. If you can\\u2019t find them, chiles de \\u00e1rbol are a good substitute. Do not use dried bird chiles here; their heat will overpower the fragrant parts of this fragrant dish.\\n\\nAll products featured on Epicurious are independently selected by our editors.

Make flax eggs by combining 4 tbsp flax meal with 12 tbsp water =\\u00bd cup. 2. Preheat the oven to 350\\u00b0F (175\\u00b0C). Cut Sunkist\\u00ae Navel Oranges into quarters. Sift your all-purpose flour. 3. Combine all ingredients required for the cake and blend on high for 30 to 45 seconds max. Over blending can cause the cake to become dense. 4. Grease a cake pan with olive oil or avocado oil spray. Pour the batter into the pan and bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. 5. Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. 6. Sift icing sugar on top and place sliced oranges.

Well, I\\u2019m going to call out a potential darkhorse dish which I hope will get it\\u2019s time on the podium soon - _Mala Dry Pot._\\n\\nNow, you may be thinking \\u201cWhat the heck is that, Phil?\\u201d - and I wouldn\\u2019t judge you. That\\u2019s because it seems to be a relatively niche dish at least here along the East Coast of the USA. I\\u2019ve only found it in 2 restaurants I\\u2019ve been to to date, and if you know how much I enjoy going to restaurants big and small, you know this dish must be a relatively rare thing. But I\\u2019ll let you in on a hint of what it is - you\\u2019ve probably heard of [Sichuan Hot Pot](https://thewoksoflife.com/hot-pot/), right? Those bubbling cauldrons of spicy, red-tinged and oil slicked broth where people are dunking in thin slices of meat, seafood, and vegetables and dipping them in all types of sauces? Well Mala Dry Pot is Hot Pot\\u2019s more assertive, bolder cousin - you know, the one that has a motorbike, enjoys wearing a leather jacket with a sherpa collar, and will go up to anyone at a bar and chat them up? That guy.\\n\\n_Anywho_ - Mala Dry Pot is a truly superior dish not only because it\\u2019s arguably event tastier than the more known Mala Hot Pot, but also because it\\u2019s easier to make and requires much less clean up and prep. If you\\u2019re a fan of spicy, savory food that will make you come back craving more, this one\\u2019s for you.\\n\\n_Let\\u2019s dive in._\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n**What is Chinese Mala Dry Pot?**So you may be thinking _\\"why is this dish a dark horse?\\"_ Well, aside from being relatively not well known at least in most parts of the USA, it has all the makings of a hype worthy dish. It\\u2019s full of bold flavor, it\'s infinitely customizable, it\'s very photogenic, and it\\u2019s made to be shared by a group - so you know it will be perfect for TikTokers to monologue over in a video. Once it starts gaining visibility as hot pot has, I expect it to enter the cultural zeitgeist in no time.\\n\\nSo what is Mala Dry Pot? To sum it up, it\\u2019s a spicy, savory, and very saucy stir fry at its heart. The \\u201cdry\\u201d of Mala Dry Pot comes from the fact that it\\u2019s not served in or with a full pot of broth like it\\u2019s cousin Sihuan hot pot is. While the mix of spices and flavors can vary, my preference, and how I\\u2019ve seen dry pot usually prepared, is choosing, prepping, and pre-cooking a mix of vegetables and proteins and quickly stir frying it with a sauce featuring a lively mix of spices, aromatics, soy and chili sauces, and fresh herbs to create a extremely fragrant, spicy, and tingly dish.\\n\\nThe core flavors of Mala dishes - szechuan peppercorn, chilis, cumin, star anise, and more feature right up front in Mala Dry Pot. These provide the robust base flavors while fresh herbs and vegetables act as the foil to bring brightness and balance. Honestly, it\\u2019s hard to describe in words, so please trust me when I say it\\u2019s a flavor I sometimes dream about.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n![Image 2: Picture](https://www.suitandapron.com/uploads/3/7/2/1/37213807/published/20221113-192718.jpg?1676238327)\\n\\nPrepping for Mala Dry Pot\\n\\nNow that I\\u2019ve hopefully sold you on giving this dish a try, there are a few steps in the lead up and prep for making dry pot. Here\\u2019s a few tips to start:\\n\\nBalance flavor and texture when picking your protein and vegetables - Remember, we eat with all our senses, so when picking what meat and proteins you want to include, get a variety of colors, textures, and flavors to really make it your own. I recommend selecting 2-3 proteins and at least 2-3 core vegetables for dry pot - that way you can enjoy mixing and matching bites.\\n\\n*   _Example Proteins:_\\n    *   Thinly sliced steak (use more tender cuts like sirloin or filet)\\n    *   Sliced chicken\\n    *   Spam\\n    *   Fried tofu (Unfried tofu may break apart)\\n    *   Shrimp\\n    *   Fish cakes or balls\\n\\n*   _Example Vegetables:_\\n    *   Bok choy\\n    *   Enoki or sliced shiitake mushrooms\\n    *   Chinese broccoli\\n    *   Bean sprouts\\n    *   Carrots\\n    *   Bamboo shoots\\n    *   Napa cabbage\\n    *   Lotus root\\n\\n*   _Other Ideas:_\\n    *   Mini dumplings or wontons\\n    *   Rice cakes\\n    *   Rice noodles\\n\\nPre-Cutting and Cooking your Ingredients - This is a critical step in making mala dry pot and helps make sure things go smoothly once you get to the final stages of cooking.\\n\\n*   _Make sure your pieces are all cut into large but bite-sized pieces_ - You don\\u2019t need something that is very small here. Cut your proteins and veg into pieces that are hearty, without making you have to unhinge your jaw\\n*   _Cook ingredients individually and have them set aside at the ready to go_ - The method you use here can vary, but I tend to like to brown and stir fry meats and hearty vegetables like carrots in oil until just cooked on the outside, and blanche leafy vegetables like bok choy until crisp-tender in a pot of salted boiling water. It\\u2019s ok if they cool down while you prep the other ingredients, you will heat them up again in the final stir fry with the sauce.\\n*   _Measure out your spices and sauces ahead of time_ - At the very end of cooking, you will be making the sauce for your dry pot and it will come together relatively quickly, so you don\\u2019t want to be fumbling around in the depths of your spice cabinet looking for cumin or bay leaves while your other spices are starting to burn. Pre-measure your spices and put them into a small dish and do the same with your liquid sauces. You can always adjust more later if you want more heat or salt or sugar. Also feel free to adjust your level of spice - add or reduce the amount of chili to your taste buds - no judgment here.\\n*   _Don\\u2019t skip on the fresh herbs_ - What takes Mala Dry Pot from A-Tier to S-Tier is the final topping of fresh herbs. Cilantro is traditional and preferred here, but fresh green onion is also wonderful and thai basil could also be a fun twist.\\n\\nHave Lots of Rice - Make more than you think you will need - I\\u2019m just going to leave it at that.\\n\\nAlright - well you\\u2019ve heard enough from me - here\\u2019s my recipe for a Mala Dry Pot. Again, my choice of meats and vegetables were purely based on what I was craving at the time, but I encourage you to create your own mix.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\nRecipe: Chinese Mala Dry Pot\\n\\nServes: 2-3\\n\\nIngredients:\\n\\n*   1/2 Can of Spam, sliced into bite-sized pieces\\n*   10-12 oz. Steak, sirloin or strip recommended, cut into bite-sized pieces\\n*   1 Large carrot, sliced thin into bite sized pieces\\n*   5-6 Napa cabbage leaves, cut into large pieces\\n*   2-3 Shanghai or Baby Bok Choy - Cut into fourths, leaving the base attached\\n*   1 Package sliced shiitake mushrooms - About 4 Oz (or substitute enoki mushrooms)\\n*   3-4 Cloves garlic, roughly chopped\\n*   1-inch Piece of ginger, roughly chopped\\n*   Handful of Cilantro, roughly chopped\\n*   1 tsp Sesame seeds\\n*   Vegetable Oil\\n\\nSauce and Spices:\\n\\n*   2 tsp Ground cumin\\n*   1 tsp Five spice\\n*   1-2 tsp Szechuan peppercorns, crushed between your fingertips until fragrant\\n*   1/2 - 3/4 tsp Szechuan or red pepper flakes\\n*   2 Bay leaves\\n*   2 Whole star anise\\n*   1 Tbl Light Soy Sauce\\n*   1 Tsp Dark Soy Sauce\\n*   1 Tbl White sugar\\n*   1 tsp Chinese black vinegar (substitute balsamic if needed)\\n*   1 tsp Shaoxing cooking wine (Substitute dry sherry if needed)\\n*   2 tsp. Spicy Chili Crisp\\n*   1 generous tsp Chili Bean Sauce (AKA [Touban Jian or Doubanjiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubanjiang))\\n*   Vegetable Oil\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\n1.   Prepare your meats and vegetables by slicing them into large, bite-sized pieces. Set aside until ready to cook\\n2.   Combine your dry spices on a small plate or bowl, and combine your sauces except for the chili-bean paste in a separate bowl. Set aside until ready to cook\\n3.   In a large pan, heat up a thin layer of oil and brown your proteins until just cooked and taking on brown color on the outside - set aside\\n4.   Cook your firm vegetables, like carrots, in the same pan until just starting to get tender, about 2-3 minutes - set aside\\n5.   Cook your mushrooms until they have released their liquids and are soft - about 3-5 minutes - set aside\\n6.   In a large pot of boiling salted water, quickly blanche your napa cabbage and bok choy for 1-2 minutes until cooked but still crisp - remove from the water and set aside\\n7.   Once all main proteins and vegetables are prepared, return the large pan over medium-low heat. Add about 3 tablespoons of oil to the pan and add the dry spices, garlic, and ginger. Stir until spices are fragrant - about 1 minute.\\n8.   Add the chili bean paste and stir into the oil mixture - cook 1-minute more until fragrant\\n9.   Add the remaining sauce ingredients, raise the heat to medium, and bring to a boil\\n10.   Turn heat to medium-high and add all the prepped proteins and vegetables back into the pan. Stir to coat all the ingredients in the sauce and let the sauce start to thicken and glaze everything - 2-3 minutes. Taste and adjust the dish as needed with salt, sugar, or chili to taste. If the sauce is too loose, you can thicken it with a cornstarch slurry.\\n11.   Remove the pan from the heat and dish onto a large serving dish or platter - sprinkle generously with fresh chopped cilantro and a sprinkle of sesame seeds\\n12.   Serve family style with lots of rice and enjoy\\n\\nLet me know if you enjoyed trying this out in the comments below. _**Cheers!**_\\n\\n![Image 3](https://www.suitandapron.com/uploads/3/7/2/1/37213807/20221113-183652_orig.jpg)Suit and Apron -------------- No celebrity chef got to the top without getting burned, cut, and spilled on at least a couple dozen times.

It is a steamed stodgy cake made with rice flour and mooli/daikon. Usually seen or served pan fried in slices. This cake is a Cantonese favourite for Chinese new year and is available in all Cantonese dim sum restaurants all year round. This fried cake in dim sum restaurant normally looks pure white and quite plain with few minute pieces of Chinese sausage etc, the seasoning is usually msg, salt and some sugar. Homemade lo bak goh usually without msg and contains more \\u6599 \'lieu\' or added ingredients, also the adding of soy sauce can make the cake looks not as white as those in restaurant. Chinese \'wax\' meat or preserved meat like lap cheong (sausage) or lap yuk (bacon), minced pork, dried shrimps or dried scallops are common ingredients added for flavour and texture.\\n\\n[![Image 2](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVO1iaukuvpJOnh9F31MZTIxgG2HLwJEPGJeOe-_OZCCC-ZPVgTs9rA8EyPdiIxQYxEMeNnnJ13iBzTi7T0KiPzmbn3v8NL3G9Lv-MZzN1pNvaMN7c7uzmtrnHumwm_ToOzfVwHbV83uLC/s400/DSC02135.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVO1iaukuvpJOnh9F31MZTIxgG2HLwJEPGJeOe-_OZCCC-ZPVgTs9rA8EyPdiIxQYxEMeNnnJ13iBzTi7T0KiPzmbn3v8NL3G9Lv-MZzN1pNvaMN7c7uzmtrnHumwm_ToOzfVwHbV83uLC/s1600-h/DSC02135.jpg)\\n\\nHere is how I normally make this savoury cake.\\n\\nIngredients:\\n\\n2 - 2.5 stick lap cheong (chinese sausage)\\n\\n100g skinless lap yuk (chinese bacon) or 100 -125g minced pork\\n\\n2 tbsp dried shrimps, soaked\\n\\nabout 3 dried shitake mushroom (about 10g), soaked removed stalk\\n\\n2 dried scallop, soaked and shredded (optional)\\n\\n2 - 3 walnut size shallots\\n\\n2 decent size clove garlic\\n\\npinch of ground pepper\\n\\n0.5 - 1 tsp salt or to taste\\n\\n1 - 2 tsp light soy sauce\\n\\nabout 750 - 800g peeled mooli or daikon\\n\\nabout 250ml water (can use the soaking water for dried shrimps and dried scallop to replace this water)\\n\\n280g rice flour\\n\\n50g tapioca starch or potato starch\\n\\n300ml room temp. homemade chicken stock (or water with added chicken stock granules about 1 heap tsp)\\n\\n1 tsp sesame oil\\n\\ncooking oil\\n\\nMethod:\\n\\n1.   Soak the lap cheong and lap yuk (if using) in boiling liquid for few minutes till soften then finely chopped. \\n2.   Finely chopped garlic, shallot, soaked mushrooms and dried shrimps. \\n3.   Grate mooli/daikon. I used the food processor grater, saves a lot of work. For a very fine cake texture and save cooking time can also puree the mooli using the food processor.\\n\\n4.   Mix rice flour, starch, sesame oil and stock together.\\n\\n5.   Heat wok with few tbsp oil and fry shallot and garlic till soften. Then add sausage, bacon (or minced pork), dried shrimps, mushroom and scallop (if using). Fry till fragrant, and make sure meat does not clump together then add remaining seasoning ingredients. Remove to one side. Check if the wok has any brown sticky bits, if yes wash before proceeding to next step. Browning bits can make the cake looks greyish or brownish.\\n\\n6.   Stir fry mooli with a little oil for about 2 minutes then add 250ml water and cook for few minutes till the mooli is softened.\\n\\n7.   Stir in flour mixture, taste to check if more seasoning is needed and cook at low heat stirring all the time for till the mixture started to thicken like runny porridge before it gets too thick heat off.\\n\\n8.   Grease a large casserole dish or non loose base aluminium baking tin or 2 - 3 disposable foil oblong/round containers. Pour cake mixture into dish/container, smooth the top with dampen fingers lightly touching the surface. Ready for steaming. For one large cake this will take about 1.5 hour, for a smaller cake about 1 hour. Test with a skewer into the centre to see there is no whitish paste to ensure it is thoroughly cooked through. Once cooked, take the cake out cover loosely and leave to cool. If without a large enough steamer can cook the cake in the oven using a water bath (large roasting tray filled with some boiling water) covered with foil.\\n\\n9.   Can be eaten while warm as it is or cut into slices when cooled and fry with a little oil till both sides are golden brown. It is much easier to slice if the cake is cooled in the fridge for few hours or overnight.\\n\\nServe the cake with or without frying with [Cantonese chilli oil](http://sunflower-recipes.blogspot.com/2009/07/cantonese-hong-kong-style-chilli-oil.html), XO sauce, soy sauce or any favourite chilli sauce.\\n\\nThis cake will keep in the fridge for 4 - 5 days or frozen in chunk. If frozen, defrost before frying.\\n\\n17 Feb 2010\\n\\nAttached is a picture from [PlumLeaf](http://alittlebitofplumleaf.blogspot.com/) who has followed this recipe.
