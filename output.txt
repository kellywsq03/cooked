You all have been asking for more simple and delicious recipes that come together fast and have minimal ingredients. This garlic butter steak recipe is so satisfying and will impress your entire family.\\n\\nThe BEST Pan-Seared Steak\\n-------------------------\\n\\nThis 20-minute recipe is done on the stovetop in one pan (no need to finish it in the oven). This is one of our favorite steak recipes and we make it year-round because it\\u2019s such a quick and convenient cooking method. That garlic butter is lip-smacking good! Read on for great tips on how to improve , reduce food waste and you will love our ideas for easy meal prep with leftover steak.\\n\\nIngredients for Garlic Butter Steak.\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nIt really doesn\\u2019t get any easier than this and you don\\u2019t need much to make a lip-smacking good steak. We used 2 New York Strip Steaks (pictured below), each weighing 1 pound and 1 1/4\\u2033 thick. Keep in mind a thicker steak will take longer to cook through and a thinner steak will cook faster.\\n\\nWell-marbled steaks will give you the juiciest results. Our favorite steaks to cook on a skillet are:\\n\\n*   New York Steak\\n*   Filet Mignon (Tenderloin)\\n*   Top Sirloin\\n*   T-Bone/Porterhouse\\n*   [Ribeye Steak](https://natashaskitchen.com/how-to-select-prime-rib-roast/)\\n\\n![Image 3: Ingredients for pan seared steak with garlic rosemary butter](https://natashaskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pan-Seared-Steak-728x485.jpg)\\n\\nHow to Pan Sear Steaks:\\n-----------------------\\n\\n1.   **Pat dry** \\u2013 use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.\\n2.   **Season generously** \\u2013 just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.\\n3.   **Preheat the pan** on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.\\n4.   **Sear steaks** \\u2013 add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).\\n5.   **Add butter and aromatics** \\u2013 melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).\\n6.   **Remove steak** and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.\\n\\n> **Pro Tip:** We prefer using a [large cast-iron pan](https://amzn.to/2QZrfw1) for best heat conduction, but a large heavy stainless steel pan will also work.\\n\\n![Image 4: Step by step photos how to season and sear a steak on a skillet](https://natashaskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pan-Seared-Steak-10-728x1092.jpg)\\n\\nSteak Doneness Temperature Chart:\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nA steaks internal temperature continues to rise as it rests, so remove steaks from the pan about 5-10 degrees before reaching your desired doneness. Use this chart to determine steak doneness when testing with an[instant-read thermometer](https://amzn.to/3v3vFsI). For example, if you desire a medium doneness steak, remove it from the pan at 135 degrees F, and it should rise to 140\\u02daF as it rests. The [USDA](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/safe-minimum-internal-temperature-chart/ct_index) recommends cooking steaks to at least 145 degrees. Read more. Use the following steak temperature chart:\\n\\n*   **Medium Rare** (soft, dark pink inside): Remove at 125\\u02daF for a final cooked temp of 130\\u02daF\\n*   **Medium** (soft, some pink inside): Remove at 135\\u02daF for a final temp of 140\\u02daF\\n*   **Medium-Well** (slightly pink center): Remove at 145\\u02daF for a final temp of 150\\u02daF\\n*   **Well Done** (very firm, little to no pink): Remove at 155\\u02daF for a final temp of 160\\u02daF\\n\\n![Image 5: Slice of steak cooked to medium doneness ](https://natashaskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pan-Seared-Steak-6-728x1092.jpg)\\n\\n**Pro Tip:** Check the temperature using an [instant-read thermometer](https://amzn.to/3v3vFsI), inserting it horizontally into the side of the steak, so it penetrates the thickest part of the center of the steak (without touching the bone or fat portions).\\n\\n![Image 6: Checking steak temperature inserting thermometer into side of steak](https://natashaskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pan-Seared-Steak-3-728x485.jpg)\\n\\nWhat to Serve with Steaks:\\n--------------------------\\n\\nSteak is so versatile but our favorite sides for making the perfect steak dinner are:\\n\\n*   [Roasted Asparagus](https://natashaskitchen.com/baked-asparagus-with-lemon-butter-and-parmesan/) or Roasted [Brussels Sprouts](https://natashaskitchen.com/roasted-brussels-sprouts/)\\n*   Creamy [Mashed Potatoes](https://natashaskitchen.com/creamy-mashed-potatoes-recipe/)\\n*   Oven-roasted Baby [Red Potatoes](https://natashaskitchen.com/oven-roasted-baby-red-potatoes/).\\n*   Another classic steak pairing is [Corn on the Cob](https://natashaskitchen.com/instant-pot-corn-on-the-cob/).\\n*   [Chimichurri Sauce](https://natashaskitchen.com/chimichurri-sauce-recipe/) is a quick way to add tons of flavor\\n\\nPro Tips for the Best Steak:\\n----------------------------\\n\\n*   Preheat pan 5 minutes before adding steak for a great sear with good color and flavor.\\n*   Press steak down just as it hits the pan to ensure steak makes contact with the surface of the pan.\\n*   Loosely cover and rest steaks on a cutting board 10 minutes before slicing so they don\\u2019t dry out.\\n*   Don\\u2019t slice too thin, or the steak cools too quickly.\\n*   Slice steak against the grain and at an angle for a steakhouse presentation\\n\\n![Image 7: Juicy steak topped with melted garlic butter and rosemary](https://natashaskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pan-Seared-Steak-5-728x1092.jpg)\\n\\nHow to Buy and Store Beef:\\n--------------------------\\n\\nWe love buying larger packages of beef, which are often a better value in price per pound. Once we have our meal plan for the week figured out, we refrigerate what we plan to cook within 3-4 days and freeze the rest. To preserve the quality of our steaks, we vacuum seal since air is the enemy of food. If you don\\u2019t have a [vacuum sealer](https://amzn.to/2wQpRF6), you can also use a freezer-safe zip bag and squeeze out as much air as possible before freezing. To reduce waste, follow these guidelines:\\n\\n*   Refrigerate Steaks (at 40\\u02daF) for 3-4 days from purchase date\\n*   Freeze Steaks for 6-12 months*\\n*   Refrigerate or freeze right after purchasing\\n*   Place in freezer bags removing as much air as possible, or vacuum seal.\\n\\n![Image 8: Vacuum sealed steaks ready for the freezer](https://natashaskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pan-Seared-Steak-2-1-728x485.jpg)\\n\\nSteak Meal Prep:\\n----------------\\n\\nDid you know 40% of all food brought home in America goes uneaten? Some of the things we do to reduce waste are to eat what we have in our kitchen and also to repurpose leftovers. Leftover steak is perfect for meal planning. Cooked beef can be refrigerated for 3-4 days or frozen 2-3 months. We love using leftover steak to meal prep Steak [Cobb Salad](https://natashaskitchen.com/cobb-salad/) in reusable [to-go containers](https://amzn.to/2V3EM79). Here are some more great ideas for using up leftover steak:\\n\\n*   Dice or thinly slice cooked steak for tacos or Steak [Fajitas](https://natashaskitchen.com/shrimp-fajitas/)\\n*   Whip up some easy [Cheesesteak Quesadillas](https://natashaskitchen.com/philly-cheesesteak-quesadilla-recipe/)\\n*   Make a quick [Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich](https://natashaskitchen.com/philly-cheesesteak/)\\n\\nLove Beef?

It quickly became a tradition for my family, and we would go out or grill in in honor of my turning one year older. Once I moved out, the tradition didn\'t stop, and it\'s something I still find myself craving and turning to as my birthday comes around each year.\\n\\nFor me, steaks and birthday celebrations are nearly synonymous, but that doesn\'t mean I _only_ eat steak as a celebration. A big steak hot from the grill on a summer weekend, eaten with my dad for Father\'s Day, sliced up with friends and served in corn tortillas\\u2014a great steak can do it all.\\n\\nBelow, I\'ve gathered up 15 of our best steak recipes featuring all of the most popular cuts, from strip steak to ribeye, skirt and flank steak to tri-tip. Whether you make them on the grill or in your kitchen, for a celebration or just another beautiful day of life, these recipes are a treat, so enjoy!\\n\\n*   [Skirt Steak with Avocado Chimichurri](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/skirt_steak_with_avocado_chimichurri/)\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n![Image 9: Quick and Easy weeknight skirt steak sliced across the grain and covered with avocado chimichurri on a white plate](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/thmb/GU9H4JT2xhKuHPkweHc2JonfgJc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__simply_recipes__uploads__2019__08__Steak-Avacado-Chimichurri-LEAD-4-0d42f5f2392040b084fac3f3b6f3c586.jpg)  \\n\\nSimply Recipes / Jessica Gavin\\n\\n[Get Recipe](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/skirt_steak_with_avocado_chimichurri/) \\n\\"Sear for a few minutes on each side for medium-rare doneness.

I rubbed them with meat tenderizer and cracked black pepper, and let them rest on the counter for about an hour. Then heated a cast-iron skillet and threw a little salt in the pan, seared the steaks about 4 or 5 minutes per side until they released from the pan. This gave them a nice browned crust while the inside remained fork-tender. Didn\'t change a thing about the sauce, these steaks were awesome!\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14554/sirloin-steak-with-garlic-butter#)\\n\\nHelpful (223)\\n\\n### Featured Tweaks\\n\\n[Jillian](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/jillian)\\n\\n03/17/2009\\n\\nWow! This is restaurant quality. We used NY strips that came out great. For the butter I used about 1/3 c. with 1 & 1/2 tsp. of minced garlic in the jar, 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder, and 1/4 tsp. dried parsley. I let it get to room temp. and made a paste. I put it back in the fridge while the steaks were on the grill.

My hubby and I found it to be wonderful. I used it on filet mignon for a special occasion and not a morsel was to be found afterwards. I also added chopped fresh chives and parsley to the butter. Just a little tip: During the holiday season, I used a recipe very similar to yours to make refrigerated crescent rolls. After unrolling the crescent rolls flat on a baking sheet, I brushed on a little of a mixture similar to this, and everyone went wild. Of course we had turkey and ham (no need for garlic), and the cresent rolls were a lively surprise & hit. I also tried this on broccoli and it was lucious.\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14554/sirloin-steak-with-garlic-butter#)\\n\\nHelpful (125)\\n\\n[NIQUE](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/126594)\\n\\n02/03/2001\\n\\nDelicious! The only thing I would do differently is use less butter to give it a thicker consistency, about a third of a cup instead of half of a cup. When I made it the second time I did that and it turned out great.

I halved the recipe which worked great.In order to help tenderize the meat about an hour before cooking the steaks, I placed them in a ziplock bag with 1 tsp cornstarch and 1/2 tsp baking soda making sure to rub the mixture into the steaks. After an hour, I washed off and patted dry each steak before grilling. My family loved it and the steaks were tender and delicious. Thank you so much for this recipe which I will definitely make again. I served this with baked potatoes and steamed broccoli.

I didn\'t use the garlic cloves but followed the rest of the recipe for the sauce. Spread the sauce on the steaks before cooking, and cooked at a preheated 400 degrees for two minutes per side. Paused my fryer and tested for doneness with an IR thermometer. Removed when temp. was rare and let sit for about five minutes while I put the rest of dinner on the table. Added a bit more sauce and served with garlic mashed potatoes and a salad. Yum! I realize that this cooking method is not for everyone, and results might vary, but it worked for me with what I had available at the time. Grilling would be preferable.\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14554/sirloin-steak-with-garlic-butter#)\\n\\nHelpful (3)\\n\\n[PapiGringo](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/5122445)\\n\\n02/08/2012\\n\\nThis was 5 star delicious. I used filet mignon, 350\' grill, lightly brushed with olive oil and a little Goode\'s Mesquite rub, three minutes on each side. Melted about a tbls. of the chilled butter mixture over each resting steak. I did not used the garlic powder, just minced garlic and added a little chopped cilantro. The remaining butter mixture was then melted down and used for a dipping sauce with added grilled shrimp.

I put under a low broiler for 4-5 minutes each side and add sliced onions underneath the steaks. I baste a couple times with the garlic butter. As someone else suggested, you do need to saute the garlic in a little butter until it\'s soft and cooked, then add in the remaining butter.

This recipe is really great. I did take the suggestion that another reviewer made, and I sauteed the minced garlic in about 2 Tbsp of butter just until caramelized, then I removed from head and added the additional butter and stirred until it was all melted together. I also decreased the garlic powder by half and just added in an additional clove of fresh. I served these with broccoli and some awesome Ore-Ida Simply Wedges Garlic & Herb potatoes and it made a wonderful dinner that I will definitely make again.\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14554/sirloin-steak-with-garlic-butter#)\\n\\nHelpful (2)\\n\\n701 Reviews Sort\\n\\nsort Reviews \\n\\nMost Helpful \\n\\nMost Positive \\n\\nLeast Positive \\n\\nNewest \\n\\n Cancel  Apply \\n\\n Filter (0) \\n\\nfilter Reviews \\n\\n By rating \\n\\n- [x] 5 star \\n\\n- [x] 4 star \\n\\n- [x] 3 star \\n\\n- [x] 2 star \\n\\n- [x] 1 star \\n\\n By type \\n\\n- [x] With photo \\n\\n Cancel  Apply \\n\\n[Stephanie Dykman](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/24872145)\\n\\n05/19/2025\\n\\nEasy to follow Great flavors\\n\\nYummy!\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14554/sirloin-steak-with-garlic-butter#)\\n\\nHelpful (0)\\n\\nAllrecipes Member\\n\\n04/14/2025\\n\\nI did not use the grill or stove with this recipe.

Indeed, pan-seared steaks have several distinct advantages over grilled steaks\\u2014enough that there are times when given the two choices, I\'ll choose pan-seared just for the sake of it. While grilling will get you a rapid-fire crust on your steak with all those delightfully crisp, on-the-verge-of-burnt bits and a good smoky flavor, I find that the even golden brown crust you can develop in a hot cast-iron pan really accentuates the flavor of the beef itself, letting it shine. On top of that, pan-searing affords you the opportunity to add your own flavorings in the form of aromatics.\\n\\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\\n\\nOf course, you gotta know how to do it before you can git \'er done.\\n\\nHow to Pan-Sear Steaks\\n----------------------\\n\\nWhen I\'ve got plenty of time to kill, I occasionally employ a low-and-slow cooking method, such as[sous vide](https://www.seriouseats.com/food-lab-complete-guide-to-sous-vide-steak), or perhaps the reverse sear method I developed at _Cook\'s Illustrated_ in which you start the steak in a very low oven and finish it off on the stovetop.\\n\\nBut you know what happens 99% of the time? I\'ve got a steak, I want to get it on the table, and I don\'t want to fuss with it. After all, a steak is a quick-cooking thing. The king of fast food, if you will. I don\'t want to have to heat up a water bath or my oven, I don\'t want to have to wait for hours. That means I want to do it start to finish on the stovetop. Luckily, this is very easy to do.\\n\\n**The TL/DR version:**start with a good, thick, well-marbled steak. Season it well. Sear it in hot oil in cast iron, flipping as often as you\'d like. Add butter and aromatics. Keep flipping and basting. Rest. Carve. DIG IN.\\n\\nRead on for the long version.\\n\\nWhat Steak Should I Use?\\n------------------------\\n\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nYou can\'t end up with a great cooked steak if you start with a crummy raw steak. For the record, we\'re talking [high-end steaks](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-four-high-end-steaks-you-should-know-ribeye-strip-tenderloin-t-bone) here\\u2014those are the tender ones cut from the loin of the cow that generally command the highest prices at the market.\\n\\nThere are four different high-end steaks that you should know and each one is a little different.\\n\\n*   **Ribeye**, also known as a Delmonico or entrec\\u00f4te,is my personal favorite. It comes with a large, tender eye of meat surrounded by a swath of fat and a cap that comes from the spinalis muscle. This cap is far and away the juiciest, most flavorful piece of meat that you\'ll find on any steak. Some folks might find a ribeye to be a little too rich and fatty. Some folks may well be lacking joy in their life.\\n*   **Strip**, also known as New York Strip, Kansas City Strip, or contre-filet,is similar in texture to that central eye of meat in a ribeye steak. That\'s because it comes from the exact same muscle, just a little further back down along the cow. People enjoy strip steak for its relatively tender texture and good amount of marbling (more on that in a minute).\\n*   **Tenderloin**, also known as filet mignon,is the most tender cut of meat on the cow. When cooked, it has a buttery, almost spoon-tender texture. But what it has in tenderness, it lacks in flavor. As a nearly unused muscle in the cow, the tenderloin generally has very little fat, and almost no flavor to speak of, despite its crazy price tag.\\n*   **T-Bone**, also known as Porterhouse when the tenderloin section is at least 1 1/2-inches wide, is simply a slice of rib with both the strip and the tenderloin still attached.\\n\\nThe Difference Between Prime And Choice\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nAll beef that\'s sold in the U.S. is graded by the United States Department of Agriculture on a scale according to its tenderness and degree of marbling. At the top of the heap is**prime**, which denotes an abundant degree of marbling in a cow under 42 months of age. Only about 2% of the beef sold in this country is [designated prime](https://www.seriouseats.com/beef-shopping-prime-high-choice-steak), and most of that goes to restaurants, specialty butchers, and high-end supermarkets. Below that is**choice**, followed by**select**, which are the two grades you\'ll find in most supermarkets.\\n\\nThe grades continue to go down all the way to**canner**, which generally comes from very old cows with little fat in their tough meat. Luckily for us, you won\'t find that grade in stores. (It\'s reserved for such savory applications as school lunches and dog food.)\\n\\nWhile checking the grade is a quick and easy indicator of the quality of the meat, what you should _really_ be checking for is the degree of marbling\\u2014that\'s the interstitial fat that shows up in white spiderwebs throughout the meat.\\n\\nWhy, you might ask, is marbling important? Two reasons: moisture and flavor. As well-marbled meat cooks, the fat will slowly melt, adding juiciness built right into the meat. Non-marbled meat might have plenty of fat on the exterior, but it doesn\'t enhance the steak in the same way. Sort of like the difference between drinking a glass of chocolate milk or drinking the milk then shooting the chocolate syrup.\\n\\nFlavorwise, almost all of the compounds our tongues sense that give us the thought, \\"Ooh, that\'s beefy,\\" are found in the fat. In fact, if you take the fat out of a piece of beef and replace it with lamb fat, it\'ll taste like lamb. Want chicken-flavored beef? Cook lean beef in chicken fat.\\n\\nIf flavor is what you\'re after,**fat is your friend**. Look for meat that\'s got plenty of marbling.\\n\\nChoose Thick Steaks\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe thickness of a steak is not _just_ about portion control. Without an adequately thick steak, it\'s very difficult to get that contrast between exterior and interior that is so desirable. Thin steaks will tend to overcook before they can finish developing a nice crust, even over the hottest fire you can muster.\\n\\nI try to get steaks that are at least an inch and a half thick, if not two inches. This does mean that each steak ends up weighing in at between 12 ounces and a pound\\u2014that\'s big, even for someone with a big appetite for red meat. But remember this:**It\'s better to cook one large steak for every two people than to cook two smaller steaks.** Learn how to share.\\n\\nDry-Aged vs Wet-Aged Meat\\n-------------------------\\n\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nThere are two types of aging. So-called**wet-aged**meat is meat that has been placed in a vacuum-sealed bag and allowed to rest for a few weeks (usually while in transit from packing plant to distributor to supermarket). A wet-aged steak shows some improvement over a standard non-aged steak in terms of tenderness\\u2014there are enzymes present in the meat that will break down tough connective tissue over time.\\n\\n**Dry-aged**meat is meat that has been stored in a temperature and humidity-controlled room for anywhere from a week and up to 10 weeks or longer. During this time, three things happen:\\n\\n*   **Moisture loss**. A dry-aged piece of beef can lose up to around 30% of its initial volume in water loss, which concentrates its flavor.\\n*   **Tenderization**occurs when enzymes naturally present in the meat act to break down some of the tougher muscle fibers.\\n*   **Flavor change**is probably the most relevant. Due to numerous reasons including enzymatic and bacterial action, properly dry-aged meat will develop deep nutty, cheesy aromas.\\n\\nWhether you want dry-aged meat or not is a matter of personal choice. I personally love the funky, blue cheese notes of a very old dry-aged steak and am willing to shell out the extra 20 to 25% it costs. Others prefer the cleaner flavor of fresh beef.\\n\\nBone-In or Boneless?\\n--------------------\\n\\nTalk to most chefs and they\'ll tell you that it\'s always better to cook meat with the bone-in because it adds flavor. I\'ve always been pretty skeptical of this one for a number of reasons. First of all, the exterior of a bone does not have much flavor in it at all\\u2014you have to dig down into the marrow to get at it (just ask my dogs). Secondly, meat muscle fibers are pretty tough customers when it comes to allowing molecules to move around within them.\\n\\nIf an overnight marinade can only penetrate meat by a few millimeters, it\'s a fat chance that flavor from a relatively flavorless bone is going to make much difference.\\n\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nIndeed, I have tested this with prime rib roasts. One I roasted bone-in, another I removed the bone and tied it back on, a third I removed the bone and tied it back on with a layer of aluminum foil in between (to completely prevent any potential transfer of flavor), and the fourth I roasted boneless.\\n\\nAll three of the roasts with bones attached in some way were indistinguishable from each other in both texture and flavor,so there\'s that myth smashed for ya. On the other hand, the boneless roast _did_ come out a little dryer in the specific region where the bone was missing. Really, a bone accomplishes two things: It prevents some moisture loss by reducing the surface area of a steak, and it keeps that section of the steak from overcooking by acting as an insulator. Ok, three things if you count looking-really-awesome as an accomplishment.\\n\\nI personally still go with bone-in cuts when I have the option because I enjoy chewing the crispy bits of fat around the bone, but don\'t let anyone force you to do it if you aren\'t interested.\\n\\nWith pan-seared steaks, bones pose another problem. As the meat heats, it contracts a bit, so while the meat of a raw, cut steak may be flush with the bone, as soon as you start cooking it, it shrinks away, causing the bone to protrude. This, in turn, elevates the meat from the pan, making it difficult to brown the areas of meat directly around the bone.\\n\\nBut there is a solution to this:basting. That is, pouring hot fat over the meat as it cooks. We\'ll get back to that in a moment.\\n\\nTips For Pan-Seared Steak\\n-------------------------\\n\\n### Salt it Well\\n\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nShould you salt your meat right before cooking, well before cooking, or how about after cooking? This is another point of contention amongst home cooks and chefs alike, and one of the ones for which steakhouse-methods often get cited as evidence. At (most) steakhouses, they salt the steak right before throwing it on the grill or under the broiler, so that must be the best way to do it at home, right?\\n\\nWell, consider that at a steakhouse, when a customer places an order for that giant c\\u00f4te du bouef, It\'s gonna take a _minimum_ of 20 minutes to get it to medium rare in the very center. That\'s a lot of minutes in waiting-at-a-restaurant-for-your-food-to-come time.**They salt right before cooking because they don\'t have the time to let the meat sit after salting.**\\n\\nTruth of the matter is that you should salt your meat at least 40 minutes before it hits the pan. When the salt first hits a steak, it sits on the surface. Through the process of osmosis, it\'ll slowly draw liquid out of the meat, which you\'ll see pool up in little droplets. As those droplets grow, the salt will dissolve in the meat juice, forming a concentrated brine. At this stage in the game\\u2014about 25 to 30 minutes in\\u2014your steak is in the absolute worst shape possible for searing. That moisture will evaporate right off, leaving you with a tough, stringy crust.\\n\\nGive it a bit more time, and eventually that brine will begin to break down some of the muscle tissue in the meat, allowing the juices to be re-absorbed, and taking the salt right along with it.\\n\\nWhat does this lead to? Meat that is both better seasoned _and_ more tender and moist when you cook it.\\n\\nAll that said, you will not be destroying anything delicious if you choose to salt your meat straight out of the fridge and into the pan.\\n\\n**Personally, I season my steaks at least a few days in advance**,to give the salt maximum time to work its way into the meat. Why steakhouses don\'t do this is a mystery to me.\\n\\nAnd remember:**USE KOSHER SALT**, not regular table salt. The larger grains of kosher salt (which should more accurately be called \\"koshering salt,\\" as salt itself is always kosher and kosher salt is coarse salt used in the koshering process) are easier to sprinkle evenly with your fingers, and will also draw more initial moisture out of the meat to dissolve than table salt.\\n\\nYou may have heard that it\'s a good idea to let your steak rest at room temperature before you sear it. Here\'s the truth: don\'t bother. A thick cut steak takes a _long_ time to rise in temperature. After half an hour sitting on a plate in the kitchen, the internal temperature of my test models only rose by about 4\\u00b0F (2\\u00b0C). Even after an hour, they\'d barely risen 9\\u00b0F (4.5\\u00b0C), not much of a difference. Cooked side-by-side against one straight from the fridge, the cooking time and eating qualities were nearly identical.\\n\\nSo while it won\'t hurt you to let your steak sit at room temperature, you\'re not really doing yourself any favors (despite what a certain very angry chef may tell you).\\n\\n### Use A Cast Iron Pan\\n\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nA [good cast iron pan](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-cast-iron-skillet) is thick, heavy, and [designed to hold on to heat for a long, long time](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-buy-season-clean-maintain-cast-iron-pans). Once properly pre-heated (that is, smoking hot), a good cast iron pan will practically sear a steak on its own, even if you lift it off its heat source. This fact is critical for the fast searing that is essential if you want to build a thick brown crust without overcooking the interior.\\n\\n### Start in Oil, Add Butter Later\\n\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nWhat\'s the best medium to sear in? Butter, or oil? Some claim that a mixture of both is best, often using the excuse that butter alone has too low a smoke point\\u2014it begins to burn and turn black at temperature too low to properly sear meat in. Somehow, cutting the butter with a bit of oil is supposed to raise this smoke point. Unfortunately, that\'s not true. It\'s because when we say that \\"butter is burnt,\\" we\'re not really talking about the butter as a whole\\u2014we\'re talking specifically about the milk proteins in butter, the little white specks you see when you melt it. It\'s these milk proteins that burn when you get them too hot, and believe me, they couldn\'t care less whether they\'re being cooked in butterfat or in oil. Either way, they burn.\\n\\nWhat all this means is that the best cooking medium for a steak is actually plain old oil. And make sure to use plenty of it so that your steak cooks nice and evenly. I like to use at least a quarter cup in a 12-inch skillet.\\n\\nAdding butter to the pan a few minutes before it\'s done cooking is a fine idea. This is just enough time to allow the buttery flavor and texture (butter is creamier tasting than oil because it has a higher percentage of saturated fat) to coat the meat, but not so long that it will burn excessively and produce acrid undertones.\\n\\nBecause it adds proteins to the mix, butter is a better medium for adding deep brown color to your steak as well, which means that even if your steak is looking a little pale after its initial sear, once you add that butter, it\'ll rapidly take on color.\\n\\n### Flip Often\\n\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nIf there\'s one piece of steak-grilling advice that people seem to get more persnickety about than anything, it\'s that your steak should only be flipped once.\\n\\n_False._ This is another hang-on gleaned from steakhouses in which it\'s simply impractical for a cook to flip more than once given the number of steaks they have cooking on a grill at the same time. At home, you\'re probably only cooking a few steaks at a time, and**it\'s ok\\u2014indeed, it\'s _better_\\u2014to flip your steaks more often.**\\n\\nYou don\'t have to take my word for it either. Famed food scientist and author Harold McGee has been advocating this method for years (and has the data to prove its efficacy). Dave Arnold over at Cooking Issues has[replicated his tests](http://www.cookingissues.com/2009/11/13/mcgee-days-two-and-three-steak-fish-burgers-and-love/), as have I([with hamburgers](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-burger-labs-top-ten-tips-for-better-burgers)). You can quite easily do the test for yourself.\\n\\nBy flipping a steak multiple times\\u2014as often as once every 15 seconds or so\\u2014you not only end up with meat that\'s more evenly cooked, you also cut down on your cook time by as much as a third,_and_ develop a great crust on top of that. This is because with multiple flips, neither side is exposed to intense heat for too long, nor does it lose much heat to the relatively cool air above. It\'s the equivalent of cooking it from both directions simultaneously.\\n\\nThat said, the difference in the end result is not _too_ pronounced, so if you want to leave the steak alone and enjoy your beer, or if you feel the need to placate that annoying uncle who gets visibly angered by multi-flippers, go ahead and use the one-flip method\\u2014it won\'t destroy your steak.\\n\\nSimilarly, using a fork to lift and flip will absolutely _not_ destroy it. To hear people balk at the fork-flippers, you\'d think that a steak is something like a water balloon, ready to shed all its moisture from a single puncture. This is not how a steak behaves. Rather than a balloon filled with liquid, a steak is actually a series of many many thousands of long, skinny balloons filled with liquid. Puncturing a single one will have no effect on its neighbor, and the amount of juice contained in a fork-poke-ful of punctures is small enough not to be noticed.\\n\\nStill, I find it easier to turn steaks with a combination of spatula-and-[tong](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-kitchen-tongs-equipment-review) or spoon-and-tong.\\n\\n### Baste with Butter\\n\\nLift up the skillet and pour butter over the steak, aiming for the paler parts to give them some color. Continue to flip and baste until the steak is approaching finished.\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nBasting is the _real_ key to a perfect pan-seared steak. It performs two different functions.\\n\\nWhen[Ed](https://www.seriouseats.com/ed-levine-5118658)walked by the kitchen in the office the other day and saw the big fat steak I was about to cook, his first question after hearing I was planning on cooking it stovetop was, \\"Isn\'t it going to burn before the inside cooks?\\"\\n\\nAnd the answer is yes\\u2014IF you cook it the traditional one-flip, no-baste way, that is. See, the problem, as Ed pointed out, is that with a screaming hot skillet, you end up overcooking the outside to a black crisp before the center has had a chance to even warm up.\\n\\nA combination of flipping and basting\\u2014that is, spooning hot fat over your meat\\u2014will help cook it more gently, and more importantly,_from both sides simultaneously_, drastically cutting down on its cooking time. A basted and flipped steak will hit its appropriate internal temperature a good 35% faster than a single-flip, no-baste steak. How\'s that for fast food?\\n\\nBasting also performs one more important function: It\'s a perfect way to perform touch-up jobs on your crust. Remember those pale spots that appear around the bones when you try and sear a bone-in steak? Spoon hot melted butter over them, and they\'ll quickly color in.\\n\\nThe easiest way to baste is to tilt your pan slightly so that hot butter collects near the handle, then use a spoon to pour it over the top of the steak.\\n\\nDid I say that that\'s all basting does? There\'s one more function: distributing flavor from your aromatics. After the butter is melted, I add a handful of herbs such as thyme or rosemary, along with some sweet alliums like shallots or garlic. They pop and sputter, releasing their aromas and rapidly infusing the fat with their flavor. When you baste, you\'re adding that aroma with each spoonful.\\n\\n### Use A Thermometer\\n\\nI can\'t possibly emphasize this one enough. Use a thermometer! Use a thermometer!**USE A THERMOMETER!**\\n\\nYes, you may look a bit less macho when you whip out a nifty[Thermapen](https://www.seriouseats.com/why-do-i-need-an-instant-read-thermometer-let-me-count-the-reasons)from your back pocket, swing out the slender probe and insert it gently into the very center of your steak to register a reading, but believe me: Perfectly cooked meat will earn you more praise and appreciation than macho posturing any day of the week.\\n\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nI like my steaks at around 130\\u00b0F (54\\u00b0C)\\u2014the medium-rare point. Many folks like their steaks rare, but to me, that\'s a waste of a good, well-marbled cut of beef. You want your fat to be warm enough that it starts melting a bit, lubricating your meat and adding flavor and juice to every bite. With meat that\'s too rare, the fat remains solid. You end up with all the calories and not nearly as much flavor.\\n\\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum with medium-well to well-done meat, not only have the juices been squeezed dry like water from a sponge, but the liquefied fat has already bought itself a one-way ticket to the bottom of your grill.\\n\\n**Remember: Thick steaks will continue to rise in temperature after you pull them off of the grill.** Heat from the exterior layers will travel in as your steak rests. Make sure to pull it off the grill a good five degrees before you reach your final target.\\n\\n**_But what if I don\'t have a thermometer?_**\\n\\nI get it. Thermapens are pretty expensive. With the amount of use mine gets (pretty much every time I cook), it\'s worth the price. There are also now [more affordable options on the market that do almost as good of a job](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-inexpensive-thermometer-review). But what if you\'re stuck in the woods with no thermometer in hand? Is there anything you can do?\\n\\n**Yes: Just go ahead and cut the sucker open to take a peek.**\\n\\nEven slicing into the steak won\'t release too many juices.\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nI _know_ that everyone tells you you shouldn\'t poke the meat lest you \\"risk losing valuable juices,\\" but honestly, [the loss is not much](https://www.seriouseats.com/perfect-pan-seared-steaks-recipe). Certainly not enough for you to notice once the steak is done. And given the alternative (overcooked meat that _will_ have lost a noticeable amount of juice), it\'s the best alternative out there.\\n\\n### Rest Before Slicing\\n\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nSince I last wrote about resting your meat, there have been some questions called as to the validity of the science behind it. Here is the prevalent theory as to why resting your steak is important (pulled from[an older article of mine](https://www.seriouseats.com/tips-for-grilling-season-meat)):\\n\\n> As the steak cooks, the muscle fibers on its exterior tighten, squeezing juices out of its surface. This creates an imbalance of juice in its interior, with most of the liquid being concentrated at the center of the meat. If you cut the steak open as soon as it comes off the grill, the juice has only one place to go\\u2014onto your plate. On the other hand,allow the steak to rest until its temperature has normalized,and the juices will distribute themselves more evenly throughout its interior. Cut the steak open, and the juice stays put exactly where it\'s supposed to be: in the meat.\\n\\nHowever, [Nathan Myhrvold](https://modernistcuisine.com/about/nathan/) of the James Beard Best Cookbook winner _Modernist Cuisine_ says otherwise. His claim is that it\'s not so much about redistribution of moisture, but that it\'s about the relative viscosity of hot versus cool liquids. The juices stay in place because they\'ve managed to thicken up a bit as they cool.\\n\\nIn either case, the fact remains:Resting your meat works.I recommend resting your steak until its internal temperature drops to about five degrees below its maximum temperature. (That is, serve a medium-rare steak at 125\\u00b0F (52\\u00b0C), or a medium steak at 135\\u00b0F (57\\u00b0C)).\\n\\n### December 2012"}, {"title": "The Best Steak You\'ll Ever Make (Restaurant-Quality) | Epicurious 101", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9hUGbg0Ljo", "snippet": "In this edition of Epicurious 101, professional chef and culinary instructor Frank Proto demonstrates how to make the best steak at home.

One of my many joys of cooking over the years, is teaching novice chefs, the basics. Training line-cooks and such. I used to be a music instructor. So, teaching (apparently) is in my blood. This was a beautiful demonstration. Now, I\'m really craving some steak!! :D\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\n Like \\n\\n 382 \\n\\n Dislike \\n\\nReply\\n\\n8 replies\\n\\n8 replies\\n\\n![Image 20](https://yt3.ggpht.com/KY25IdkMtTs29SVW3h2FcHkm0lwOGgp2-KBmUIO81ze92s3Bwv47Df4PtSAegnqrtcAc2DJ_jA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj)\\n\\n### [@envama2319](https://www.youtube.com/@envama2319)\\n\\n[1 day ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9hUGbg0Ljo&lc=UgybxBApDtxKYlBMODx4AaABAg&pp=0gcJCSMANpG00pGi)\\n\\nSeen a ton of videos on steak,this is my favorite\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\n Like \\n\\n 1 \\n\\n Dislike \\n\\nReply\\n\\n![Image 21](https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_mbN-xrt7GYwsfP3jEJtPxnzT6DrYVNshE8Wdv2ZiA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj)\\n\\n### [@DCYote1](https://www.youtube.com/@DCYote1)\\n\\n[9 months ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9hUGbg0Ljo&lc=UgzHS3Bdn0xQHIUaiKh4AaABAg)\\n\\nI\'ve always wrapped my steak in aluminum foil to rest and have always been disappointed because it seemed like no matter what method (Reverse sear, sear/bake, etc) I used the meat always seemed tough.

Plus, it\'s super easy to throw together in minutes.\\n\\nWhy Marinate a Steak?\\n---------------------\\n\\nMarinating a steak before cooking serves two purposes: It helps tenderize the meat and adds just the right amount of flavor. Some top-quality steaks can go without a marinade, since they\'re already full of meaty flavor and, with the right prep, end up juicy and tender without any help from a marinade. Budget-friendly steaks, however, benefit tremendously from marination. You\'ll be shocked at the difference a good marinade makes!\\n\\n### Steak Marinade Ingredients\\n\\nThese are the ingredients you\'ll need to make homemade steak marinade \\u2014 you may already have most of the ingredients you\'ll need:\\n\\n**\\u00b7 Oil**: This top-rated steak marinade recipe starts with olive oil, which keeps the meat nice and moist.\\n\\n**\\u00b7 Sauces**: You\'ll need Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce. Hot sauce is optional, but it\'s a great addition for people who appreciate a little heat.\\n\\n**\\u00b7 Lemon juice**: The acidity from the lemon juice cuts through the other flavors, adding welcome brightness. The acid also helps tenderize the meat even further.\\n\\n**\\u00b7 Spices and seasonings**: This flavorful marinade is seasoned with dried basil, garlic powder, dried parsley flakes, white pepper, and minced garlic.\\n\\nHow to Make Homemade Steak Marinade\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nTo make this steak marinade recipe at home, simply blend all the ingredients together. That\'s it! You\'ll find the full, step-by-step recipe with more detailed instructions below.\\n\\nHow Long to Marinate a Steak?\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nHow long to marinate your steak depends on the size and variety of the cut you\'re using.\\n\\n**\\u00b7**Thinner cuts, such as skirt or flanks steaks, should be marinated for 2-4 hours.\\n\\n**\\u00b7**Tougher cuts, such as top sirloin or sirloin tip, will benefit from marinating overnight (about 8 hours).\\n\\n![Image 6: Best Steak Marinade in Existence](https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/SznJC5RPk2RoGomsG9QgsV4t-WU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4537368-2000-5d29dc0518c64986b78c804e32965fd5.jpg)\\n\\nHappyschmoopies\\n\\nHow to Use Steak Marinade\\n-------------------------\\n\\nPour the marinade into a resealable plastic bag. Add steak, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for up to 8 hours. Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Cook or grill steaks to desired doneness.\\n\\n**Tip from**[**Kookie**](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/1542483): Serve your steak with a [wedge salad](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/150738/wedge-salad-with-elegant-blue-cheese-dressing/) to complete the meal.\\n\\nWhat to Do With Leftover Marinade\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nYou may be tempted to re-use the marinade straight from the bag, but don\'t! A used marinade is _not_ safe to use as-is. In fact, the bacteria from the raw meat could make you (and your dinner guests) very, very sick.\\n\\nAll that flavorful marinade doesn\'t have to go to waste, though: You can make it safe-to-eat by boiling the liquid for several minutes. This process will also reduce the liquid, resulting in a thick sauce that\'ll work well with your freshly cooked steak.\\n\\n**Learn more**: [How to Safely Reuse a Meat Marinade](https://www.allrecipes.com/article/can-you-reuse-marinade/)\\n\\nAllrecipes Community Tips and Praise\\n------------------------------------\\n\\n\\"I didn\'t even have the Worcestershire sauce and it was amazing,\\" raves [Juliec](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/11615868). \\"Made the steak a little crispy on the outside and so tender on the inside with a great flavor.\\"\\n\\n\\"I marinated tri-tips for about 8 hours and it was fantastic,\\" says [Kenzie](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/14592683). \\"It made the meat very tender and the flavor was amazing.

Using a steak marinade that has acidic ingredients, such as lemon juice will certainly tenderize meat which can be helpful for pot roast, but a pot roast can easily go from Sunday dinner to Monday\'s trashcan. Too much acid for too long can make the meat mushy. \\n\\nBy thedailygourmet[](https://www.allrecipes.com/allstars-8661275)\\n\\nI have marinated a chuck roast in this for 5 days.

I actually didn\'t add the last 4 ingredients. I didn\'t have parsley flakes & just forgot the pepper. I marinated 4 large Ribeyes for about 4-5 hours and the steaks were delicious, best I\'ve ever cooked. My husband took one of the steaks to work 2 days later and microwaved it for lunch. He was concerned that it might be dry or tough and said it tasted even better. Great recipe.

Marinaded for 6 hours- Turn the Grill on HIGH and with the lid down get the inside temp to 400, (wait untill its up there), sear the meat on all sides opening and the lid to to check and flip. When seared or blackened to desired crust, turn the grill on LOW to cool it, untill the temperature gets down to about 275 or 300. When the grill cools down you can close the lid and cook the meat turning occasionally until the inside temperature of the meat is to the desired temperature. (150 is good) Take the meat out on plate cover with a dish cloth for about 10 min to let the meat rest. Nothing else needed. This is the marinade I chose to use for the tenderloins at the company picnic.There were 3 tenderlions about 3 lbs each, 9 lbs total. I doubled the recipe for the marinade. I used both the minced garlic and the powdered garlic. Don\'t use \'Salt Garlic\'. And for the \'Lemon Juice\' I used \'Real Lemon\' in the bottle. I used \'Black Pepper\', not the white because I like how it crusts. And for the hot sauce I used \'Red Pepper\' powder. The hot pepper boost serves to balances the spices it does not make the meat hot at all.. I used \'Extra Virgin Olive Oil\' because it has more flavor. I wanted to stretch the recipe so I added about 1/3 cup more oil. I split marinade up into three plastic zippos, threw a tenderloin in each one. Marinaded it in the frig, turning the bag over a few times over a 6 hour period.\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/143809/best-steak-marinade-in-existence#)\\n\\nHelpful (32)\\n\\nNobleToast2942\\n\\n09/23/2024\\n\\nFollowed the recipe and we were all delighted! There were multiple comments about how tender and flavorful the meat was. I used skirt steaks and marinated them overnight. Then seared them in a cast iron skillet and cooked them on low in a crockpot for a few hours. Perfect! I also added chopped onion and green bell pepper, which I sauteed in the same skillet before adding it all to the crockpot.

I do. I decided to make two strip steaks and I marinated them in this recipe for 4 hours, then grilled them to medium. I served the steaks and waited for a comment. The comment was \\"what did you do to this steak? It\'s fantastic!\\" When I told hubs that I marinated the steaks, he said to keep doing it, as it was a \\"keeper\\". The only changes I made to the recipe were- 1) I just mixed the marinade up in the zip lock bag and 2) I added 1 tablespoon of a smoky flavored barbeque sauce.

I stuck pretty much exactly to recipe and used it on sirloin. Perfect cut for this marinade. It was the best steak I\'ve ever cooked. I don\'t think blender is necessary. I just put all ingredients in a gallon ziploc and shake it up then add steak. For a single 1 lb. steak I cut the portions in half and it was still more than enough.

Neither of us was particularly confident in the kitchen but we quickly discovered we could manage steaks on the grill. Add a baked potato and we felt like we were fine dining. When you\\u2019re 25 every steak dinner feels like you\\u2019re at a five star restaurant, am I right?\\n\\nI\\u2019ve had fewer opportunities for steak since David\\u2019s alpha-gal diagnosis around 6 years ago (because it means he\\u2019s allergic to red meat). Ya\\u2019ll have never seen a sadder man than David when he\\u2019s surrounded by steak he can\\u2019t have. Now I save my steak nights for when he\\u2019s on business trips. This means it\\u2019s just the kids and I for dinner so I quickly found ways to make steak as easy and kid-friendly as possible. This sheet pan meal absolutely accomplishes that, friend.\\n\\n![Image 2](blob:http://localhost/b3e13bbba1514f9b569e5ae0202985f3)[](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?media=https%3A%2F%2Fthewholecook.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F03%2FEasy-Sheet-Pan-Steak-Dinner-by-The-Whole-Cook-Pinterest.jpg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fthewholecook.com%2Fsheet-pan-steak-dinner%2F&is_video=false&description=Enjoy%20steak%20any%20night%20of%20the%20week%20with%20this%20easy%20sheet%20pan%20meal.%20Tender%20sliced%20steak%20is%20made%20flavorful%20with%20a%20simple%20marinade%20and%20then%20cooks%20in%20the%20oven%20with%20asparagus%20and%20potato%20wedges.%20You%27ll%20love%20the%20taste%20and%20you%27ll%20really%20love%20the%20minimal%20clean%20up!)\\n\\nFor this recipe you\\u2019ll need (full list of ingredients and instructions are in the recipe card below):\\n\\n*   Potatoes\\n*   Sirloin steak\\n*   Asparagus\\n*   Olive oil\\n*   Coconut aminos\\n*   Seasonings\\n\\nTo make this sheet pan meal you\\u2019ll first combine the marinade ingredients and steak.

If you have the time you can also marinate the steak for up to 12 hours. So go with which ever option works well for your schedule!\\n\\nWhat potatoes are best to use?\\n------------------------------\\n\\nI recommend russet, gold, or yellow potatoes for this recipe.\\n\\nWhat size baking sheet should you use?\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nI use a 12 x 17 baking sheet for all my sheet pan recipes. This accommodates a lot of food without overcrowding.\\n\\nWhat is a substitute for coconut aminos?\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you don\\u2019t have coconut aminos you can use a low sodium soy sauce. I personally made the switch to coconut aminos about six years ago because it tastes nearly identical but contains zero soy and a lot less sodium. I have an[entire blog post about coconut aminos if you want to learn more](https://thewholecook.com/what-is-coconut-aminos/).\\n\\n![Image 4](blob:http://localhost/659926dcafebe7d5f163fbc40297dcc3)[](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?media=https%3A%2F%2Fthewholecook.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F03%2FEasy-Sheet-Pan-Steak-Dinner-by-The-Whole-Cook-Pinterest.jpg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fthewholecook.com%2Fsheet-pan-steak-dinner%2F&is_video=false&description=Enjoy%20steak%20any%20night%20of%20the%20week%20with%20this%20easy%20sheet%20pan%20meal.%20Tender%20sliced%20steak%20is%20made%20flavorful%20with%20a%20simple%20marinade%20and%20then%20cooks%20in%20the%20oven%20with%20asparagus%20and%20potato%20wedges.%20You%27ll%20love%20the%20taste%20and%20you%27ll%20really%20love%20the%20minimal%20clean%20up!)\\n\\nHow to slice your potato wedges\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nYou want to start with potatoes that are the same size. Then cut the wedges so that every wedge is uniform in size. This helps them all cook evenly and you won\\u2019t end up with some overcooked or undercooked wedges.\\n\\nLarge potatoes: Slice in half lengthwise. Then slice each half into fourths (also lengthwise). You\\u2019ll have 8 total wedges.\\n\\nMedium potatoes: Slice in half lengthwise. Then slice each half into thirds (also lengthwise). You\\u2019ll have 6 total wedges.\\n\\nSmall potatoes: Slice in half lengthwise. Then slice each half in half (also lengthwise). You\\u2019ll have 4 total wedges.\\n\\nHow to store leftovers\\n----------------------\\n\\nLeftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.\\n\\n#### Potatoes\\n\\n*   \\u25a2  1 lb potatoes\\n*   \\u25a2  1 1/2 tbsp olive oil, extra virgin\\n*   \\u25a2  1/2 tsp garlic powder\\n*   \\u25a2  1/2 tsp salt\\n*   \\u25a2  1/4 tsp black pepper\\n\\n#### Steak\\n\\n*   \\u25a2  1 lb top sirloin steak, thinly sliced, about 1/2-inch thick pieces\\n*   \\u25a2  1 1/2 tbsp coconut aminos, can sub reduced sodium soy sauce\\n*   \\u25a2  1/2 tsp salt\\n*   \\u25a2  1/2 tsp black pepper\\n*   \\u25a2  1/4 tsp paprika\\n*   \\u25a2  1/4 tsp garlic powder\\n\\n#### Asparagus\\n\\n*   \\u25a2  1 lb fresh asparagus, trimmed\\n*   \\u25a2  2 tsp olive oil , extra virgin\\n*   \\u25a2  1/4 tsp salt\\n\\n*   Combine the coconut aminos, salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder in a resealable plastic bag or bowl. Add the sliced sirloin to the marinade, seal the bag (or bowl), and toss to coat. Set aside while you prepare the other ingredients. (You can marinate for up to 12 hours if you prefer.)\\n\\n*   Preheat the oven to 400\\u00b0F. Line a 12\\"x 17\\"baking sheet with parchment paper.\\n\\n*   Slice your potatoes in half lengthwise. Then lay both halves on the cutting board and slice each half 2 to 4 times (depending on the size of the potato) to create wedges.\\n\\nLarge potatoes: Slice in half lengthwise. Then slice each half into fourths (also lengthwise). You\'ll have 8 total wedges.\\n\\nMedium potatoes: Slice in half lengthwise. Then slice each half into thirds (also lengthwise). You\'ll have 6 total wedges.\\n\\nSmall potatoes: Slice in half lengthwise. Then slice each half in half (also lengthwise). You\'ll have 4 total wedges. \\n*   Add potato wedges to prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Use a spatula or your hands to stir and fully coat potatoes. Spread coated potatoes on baking sheet. Place in the oven and bake for 20 minutes.\\n\\n*   Remove potatoes from oven. Carefully flip potatoes and move them so they\'re in a single layer occupying about 1/3 of the baking sheet.\\n\\n*   Spread marinated steak on one third of baking sheet beside potatoes. Add asparagus to remaining one third. Drizzle olive oil on asparagus. Add the salt to the asparagus. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until steak is how you like it.\\n\\nCalories: 327 kcal, Carbohydrates: 26 g, Protein: 30 g, Fat: 12 g, Saturated Fat: 3 g, Polyunsaturated Fat: 1 g, Monounsaturated Fat: 7 g, Cholesterol: 67 mg, Sodium: 927 mg, Potassium: 1126 mg, Fiber: 5 g, Sugar: 3 g, Vitamin A: 923 IU, Vitamin C: 29 mg, Calcium: 69 mg, Iron: 5 mg\\n\\nNutrition information is automatically calculated, so should only be used as an approximation."}, {"title": "The Absolute Best Way to Cook Steak, According to So Many Tests", "link": "https://food52.com/blog/24417-how-to-cook-steak", "snippet": "Learn the best way to cook steak in the oven, on the grill, on the stove, and using sous vide.

Today, she tackles steak._\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nIn 1988, my parents bought their first meat thermometer.\\n\\nThey were in a butcher shop in Huntington, Long Island, and the white jacket\\u2013clad man with whom they were speaking was floored to hear that they didn\'t already own one. They\'d just selected a New York Strip, a rare treat for young journalists paying off student loans, and they were afraid to ruin it. So they\'d asked him: What\'s the best way to [cook this steak](https://food52.com/recipes/13436-bloody-good-steak)?\\n\\n\\"Sear it on the grill, to medium-rare,\\" he\'d said, volunteering some degrees-Fahrenheit benchmark they should use. And then, upon seeing their faces: \\"Don\'t tell me you don\'t own a meat thermometer. You _don\'t_ own a meat thermometer?!\\" He rustled around in his meat surgeon uniform pockets for a [Taylor](https://www.amazon.com/Taylor-Precision-Products-Classic-Thermometer/dp/B00004XSC0) model, and that was that.\\n\\n[![Image 1: 21 Steak Dinner Ideas for Date Night & Beyond](https://images.food52.com/khOhm9ApLsD3ESWDcNWdYTCd99k=/2000x0/a10038b2-6674-43ef-8149-f8b21718c926--2018-0907_roys-3-ingredient-soy-steak-sauce-genius_3x2_ty-mecham_001.jpg)](https://food52.com/blog/9728-8-steaks-for-valentine-s-day)\\n\\n[![Image 2: The Absolute Best Way to Cook Bacon, According to So Many Tests](blob:http://localhost/63adff11dad904a1878c568edbadacdf)](https://food52.com/blog/23779-how-to-cook-bacon-best-way-make-bacon-in-the-oven-skillet)\\n\\nHis advice was, it turns out, just one of many answers. A quick Google search on \\"how to cook steak\\" reveals nearly 300 million suggestions. You _could_ grill your meat. Or, you could cook it in a blistering skillet on the stovetop. You could start it on the stovetop, before transferring it to the oven. You could [make like Bobby Flay](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/perfect-porterhouse-steak) and sear it on the stovetop, slice it, and _then_ broil the other side. There\'s the [reverse sear](https://www.google.com/search?ei=iYFEXZXmCvChgge_pZzABw&q=reverse+sear+steak&oq=reverse+sear+steak&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i71l8.0.0..2478...0.0..0.0.0.......0......gws-wiz.3U2LnWNCoGU&ved=0ahUKEwjVzr2M6eTjAhXwkOAKHb8SB3gQ4dUDCAs&uact=5), and there\'s sous vide, and the list goes on.\\n\\nWhich makes steak a perfect candidate for our [Absolute Best Tests](https://food52.com/tags/absolute-best-tests) series, in which I spend far too much time with one specific ingredient or recipe, in an effort to coax out perfection. (Afterwards, my home almost always smells terrible for days.) Shall we begin?\\n\\nAs always, I identified a few constants to maintain across all of the different methods I tested for cooking a steak. **I chose to cook a Porterhouse steak** that was roughly 1\\u00bd-inches thick, but you can use your favorite cut, whether it\'s a filet, strip steak, or hanger. Before cooking a steak on a pan in the oven, stovetop skillet, [or sous vide](https://food52.com/blog/26466-best-sous-vide-cooker-machine), **pat it dry and season with ample amounts of kosher salt and black pepper**\\u2014with the exception of the grilled steak, which I brushed lightly with oil before receiving its salt and pepper. I also **let the steak come to room temperature for 45 minutes** before its test method (this enables steak to cook more evenly because its muscles are more relaxed. This is a great rule of thumb for most proteins, albeit 45 minutes may not be necessary for smaller cuts of fish and you may need more time for whole chickens or turkeys). **The steak was also consistently cooked in high heat\\u2013friendly vegetable oil** anywhere oil is mentioned, and **unsalted room temperature butter** anywhere butter is mentioned.\\n\\nI prefer a steak cooked to medium-rare (130\\u00b0F), as I know most chefs do. **To test the internal temperature, [I used a meat thermometer](https://food52.com/shop/products/9075-yummly-smart-thermometer?sku=30426).** Once it reached the right temperature, I removed the steak from the heat and allowed it to rest for 10 minutes before slicing (though apparently, this is unnecessary for steak that\'s been cooked via sous vide or reverse sear).\\n\\nNote that, in lieu of a meat thermometer, [there\'s a common touch test](https://food52.com/blog/12895-the-easiest-way-to-tell-when-your-steak-is-done) employed to ascertain whether steak is medium-rare: Use a pointer finger to test whether your meat is as firm as your inner thumb pad when you\'re touching your thumb to your middle finger\'s tip. However, food safety experts advise against this method because the only way to guarantee if your meat has reached the right temperature is by using a meat thermometer.\\n\\n[](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button)\\n\\n![Image 3](blob:http://localhost/63adff11dad904a1878c568edbadacdf)\\n\\nPhoto by Ella Quittner\\n\\n#### Method:\\n\\nAdd a few tablespoons oil to a large cast iron skillet, and heat over a high flame until the oil just begins to smoke. Add the steak and cook for 30 seconds. Flip, and repeat. Do this until a golden-brown crust starts to develop, which takes about four minutes, then add a few tablespoons of butter and continue to cook and flip until until 130\\u00b0F is reached. (This is a loose adaptation of J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\'s Genius [pan-seared steak recipe](https://food52.com/recipes/67882-j-kenji-lopez-alt-s-butter-basted-pan-seared-thick-cut-steaks).)\\n\\n#### Overall Ease & Efficiency of Method:\\n\\nThe stovetop-only method was by far the easiest and most efficient, requiring no special equipment or hot\\u2013skillet transfers.\\n\\n#### Tenderness of Meat:\\n\\nSixth most tender (last place). The meat was chewier in its center than the resulting meat from the other tests\\u2014but, that\'s on a relative basis. It was still thoroughly delicious and pleasant to eat.\\n\\n#### Char:\\n\\nFifth best char, meaning it was decent\\u2014better than that of the sous vide steak (in last place), but not as deep as I would have liked, because the meat came to 130\\u00b0F before it had developed a fully browned crust. This also meant I had a limited time to try to render the fat from its sides, which heated the meat several degrees more as I attempted it. (It\'s possible I could have better controlled for this by adjusting the flame temperature down, but I was worried that decrease would diminish the char as well.)\\n\\n[](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button)\\n\\n![Image 4](blob:http://localhost/63adff11dad904a1878c568edbadacdf)\\n\\nPhoto by Ella Quittner\\n\\n#### Method:\\n\\nPreheat oven to 375\\u00b0F. Add a few tablespoons oil to a [large cast iron skillet](https://food52.com/shop/products/8721-le-creuset-signature-cast-iron-skillet-11-75-inch?sku=28595), and heat over a high flame until the oil just begins to smoke. Add the steak and sear each side (including the thin, fatty sides to render) for two to three minutes each without disturbing, until browned. Transfer to oven with a tablespoon of butter to finish cooking until 130\\u00b0F is reached.\\n\\n#### Overall Ease & Efficiency of Method:\\n\\nThe stovetop-to-oven method is relatively easy, if you remember to preheat your oven while letting the steak come to room temperature. That said, it\'s a pain to transfer a screaming hot skillet mid-cook, and somewhat annoying to keep having to open the oven door to take its temperature. On an efficiency basis, it was a lengthier process than the stovetop-only and the stovetop-to-broiler steaks, about equal to the grilled steak, and quicker than the sous vide and reverse sear steaks.\\n\\n#### Tenderness of Meat:\\n\\nFourth most tender. The meat was chewier than that of the reverse sear, stovetop-to-broiler, and sous vide steaks, a bit more tender than the stovetop-only steak, and tied with the grilled steak.\\n\\n#### Char:\\n\\nThird best char. This test yielded a better char than the stovetop-only, reverse sear, and sous vide steaks, but a lighter char than the grilled and stovetop-to-broiler steak.\\n\\n[](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button)\\n\\n![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/63adff11dad904a1878c568edbadacdf)\\n\\nPhoto by Ella Quittner\\n\\n#### Method:\\n\\nPreheat broiler. Add a few tablespoons oil to a large cast iron skillet, and heat over a high flame until the oil just begins to smoke. Add the steak and do not move for three minutes. Flip the steak, top with a tablespoon of butter, and transfer to broiler to finish cooking (just a few minutes) until 130\\u00b0 F is reached.\\n\\n#### Overall Ease & Efficiency of Method:\\n\\nSimilar as the stovetop-to-oven steak, except a bit more efficient. But, the margin of error is slimmer with this method, vis-a-vis reaching medium-rare. So in that sense, it\'s slightly more anxiety-provoking.\\n\\n#### Tenderness of Meat:\\n\\nSecond most tender, after the sous vide steak. (Somehow, more tender than the stovetop-to-oven steak.)\\n\\n#### Char:\\n\\nSecond best char, after the grilled steak.\\n\\n[![Image 6: The Absolute Best Way to Boil Eggs, According to So Many Tests](blob:http://localhost/63adff11dad904a1878c568edbadacdf)](https://food52.com/blog/24274-how-to-boil-eggs)\\n\\n[](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button)\\n\\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/63adff11dad904a1878c568edbadacdf)\\n\\nPhoto by Ella Quittner\\n\\n#### Method:\\n\\nPreheat oven to 200\\u00b0F. Arrange the steak on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, and cook 30 to 35 minutes, until it registers as 115\\u00b0F. Then, take it out and sear it in a hot cast iron skillet in which you\'ve let a tablespoon of oil get to smoking over a high flame. Add a tablespoon of butter with the steak, and sear about 45 seconds on each side, including on the thin edges, until 130\\u00b0F is reached.\\n\\n#### Overall Ease & Efficiency of Method:\\n\\nEqually easy as the stovetop-to-oven and stovetop-to-broiler methods (aka, you\'re required to move a pan of meat around), though it does result in twice as many dirty dishes. Less efficient than the stovetop, stovetop-to-oven, or stovetop-to-broiler steaks; about equally efficient as the grilled steak; and more efficient than the sous vide steak.\\n\\n#### Tenderness of Meat:\\n\\nThird most tender, after the sous vide and the stovetop-to-broiler steaks.\\n\\n#### Char:\\n\\nFourth best sear, after the grilled, stovetop-to-broiler, and stovetop-to-oven steaks. As with the stovetop-only and the sous vide steaks, I wasn\'t able to get as intense a char as I would\'ve liked before it came to temperature.\\n\\n[](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button)\\n\\n![Image 8](blob:http://localhost/63adff11dad904a1878c568edbadacdf)\\n\\nPhoto by Ella Quittner\\n\\n#### Method:\\n\\nPlace the steak in a plastic zip-top bag, and seal using the [displacement method](https://www.sousvideways.com/displacement-method/) (or vacuum seal if you have a set-up). Use the sous vide to cook the steak at 129\\u00b0F for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Then, remove the steak from its bag, and pat it dry with paper towels. Heat a large cast iron skillet with a few tablespoons of oil over a high flame until the oil starts to smoke. Add the steak and a tablespoon of butter. Flip roughly every 30 seconds, until steak has a golden brown sear going on all sides, including the thin sides.\\n\\n#### Overall Ease & Efficiency of Method:\\n\\nNot easy or efficient. Using the sous vide method means you need to purchase an [expensive tool](https://www.amazon.com/ChefSteps-Joule-Watts-White-Stainless/dp/B01M8MMLBI), and cook your meat for much longer (at a lower temperature) than any other method. It also means fiddling with a phone app for the appliance, which is never fun with messy cooking fingers. Plus, you still have to use a skillet for the sear at the end, meaning more dishes than any other method.\\n\\n#### Tenderness of Meat:\\n\\nThe sous vide method, true to lore, delivered the most tender steak. That said\\u2014and it\'s hard to know why\\u2014the flavor of the meat was somehow flatter than that of the stovetop-to-broiler steak.\\n\\n#### Char:\\n\\nSixth best char (last place). I wasn\'t able to achieve a deep enough char, because the meat came to 130\\u00b0F well before the crust was fully browned.\\n\\nFrom Our Shop\\n\\n[![Image 9: Breville Joule Sous Vide](https://images.food52.com/IB_lXvB9frNNpO4aXWl-dGH45T8=/1040x1040/814f56c7-5f17-4f95-9962-d36e6d161d4f--2021-1029_breville_joule-sous-vide_1x1_julia-gartland_470.jpg)](https://food52.com/shop/products/8940-breville-joule-sous-vide)\\n\\n[![Image 10: ZWILLING Enfinigy Sous Vide Stick](https://images.food52.com/NXWrGORzZx5z3F8yXsyd284_rrY=/1040x1040/a685e72b-81ed-4844-a307-679c2cee81b1--2021-1101_zwilling_sous-vide-stick_detail-1_silo_ty-mecham.jpg)](https://food52.com/shop/products/9355-zwilling-sous-vide-stick)\\n\\n[](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button)\\n\\n![Image 11](blob:http://localhost/63adff11dad904a1878c568edbadacdf)\\n\\nPhoto by Ella Quittner\\n\\n#### Method:\\n\\nPreheat grill (I used a [Big Green Egg](https://biggreenegg.com/) and lump charcoal) to 600\\u00b0F. Place the steak on the grill, close, and cook for about three minutes. Open the grill and check on the bottom side, which should have a nice char. Flip and grill the other side another three-ish minutes, until 130\\u00b0F is reached.\\n\\n#### Overall Ease & Efficiency of Method:\\n\\nHaving to buy charcoal and let a grill preheat to a high temperature is a pain. This was way less easy and efficient than the stovetop and oven methods, though still easier and more efficient than the sous vide steak. Also, unlike the sous vide method, if you\'re going to the trouble of stocking charcoal and preheating your grill, you can [make a meal out of it](https://food52.com/blog/10478-27-genius-recipes-for-the-grill) with sides and other proteins.\\n\\n#### Tenderness of Meat:\\n\\nFourth most tender (tied with stovetop-to-oven steak). That said, the grilled steak tasted heads and shoulders above the other steaks, despite being slightly less tender.\\n\\n#### Char:\\n\\nEasily the most charred (first place).\\n\\nFrom Our Shop\\n\\n[![Image 12: Wood-Handled Stainless Steel Grill Tools](https://images.food52.com/ZWZbp8tEVHeE4Iscqwuh0dYANJ0=/1040x1040/682dece3-5502-4835-a321-8bbbc25301db--2021-0407_barebones-living_wood-handled-stainless-steel-grill-tools_fish-spatula_1x1_julia-gartland_250.jpg)](https://food52.com/shop/products/8426-wood-handle-grill-tools)\\n\\nMaybe your friends are coming over in less than an hour, or maybe it\\u2019s the first time you\\u2019re preparing a home-cooked meal for your new partner. You need to know the best way to cook a steak and you need to know now! Long story short, if you have a grill and you can get it really hot, what are you waiting for? The best way to cook a steak is on a grill. There, I said it. Do that. It just tastes better. [Cooking steak on a grill](https://food52.com/blog/10478-27-genius-recipes-for-the-grill) yielded the most charred meat with the absolute best flavor, thanks to the smoky coals. While the meat was not as tender as other methods like sous vide steak and the stovetop-to-broiler method, I believe the flavor and crackly charred exterior makes up for a little chewiness.\\n\\nIf, like me, you\'re a sad city dweller most of the year and don\\u2019t have access to a grill, go for the stovetop-to-broiler for the most efficient method with the charriest char and the most tender meat. It also requires no pricey kitchen equipment (looking at you sous vide). If you have a good cast iron skillet (please tell me you do), that\\u2019s as good as gold.\\n\\n_What method do you swear by to cook the perfect steak? Let us know in the comments._ _This post was updated in December 2021 to include additional cooking tips from our editors._"}, {"title": "How To Cook Steak On The Stovetop", "link": "https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/how-to-cook-steak-on-the-stovetop.html", "snippet": "If you\'re wondering how to cook a steak that rivals a high-end steak house, the key is mastering the simple technique of pan-searing.", "content": "This post may contain affiliate links. Read my [full disclosure policy](https://www.onceuponachef.com/privacy-policy).\\n\\n_Pan-searing is the best\\u2014and easiest\\u2014way to cook a steak. Master this technique to whip up a steak that rivals your favorite steakhouse._\\n\\n![Image 1: Steak in a skillet with butter.](https://www.onceuponachef.com/images/2019/09/How-to-Pan-Sear-Steak-760x551.jpg)\\n![Image 2: Tested & Perfected Recipes](https://www.onceuponachef.com/wp-content/themes/ouac2018/images/tested-stamp.svg)\\n\\nI love the kind of dinner you can whip up without relying on a recipe. Truth be told, good cooking is more about mastering techniques than following recipes, and the best dishes are often the simplest to make. A perfectly cooked steak is a prime example. With just a handful of ingredients and a single pan, you can prepare a steak that rivals anything you\\u2019d enjoy at a high-end steakhouse.\\n\\nThe secret is mastering the art of pan-searing. This classic technique involves cooking the surface of your food undisturbed in a piping hot pan until a crisp, golden-brown, and flavorful crust forms. It\\u2019s the key to building flavor and texture in a dish while preventing sticking and giving your meal a restaurant-quality appearance. Pan-searing is hands-down the best way to cook a steak (it works wonders for [salmon](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/restaurant-style-pan-seared-salmon.html) and [scallops](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/pan-seared-scallops-with-lemon-butter.html), too), and it also happens to be incredibly easy.\\n\\nWhat you\\u2019ll need to Cook Steak on The Stovetop\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\n![Image 3: Ingredients including vegetable oil, thyme, and pepper.](https://www.onceuponachef.com/images/2019/09/How-to-Pan-Sear-a-Steak-1-760x517.jpg)\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWhen it comes to beef, the best candidates for pan-searing are boneless, quick-cooking cuts between one and one-and-a-half inches thick, such as NY Strip, rib eye or filet mignon. (For larger or slow-cooking cuts, like [beef tenderloin with red wine sauce](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/roast-beef-tenderloin-wine-sauce.html) or [beef stew with carrots and potatoes](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/beef-stew-with-carrots-potatoes.html), pan-searing is usually the first step, and then you finish the cooking in the oven.)\\n\\nTo begin, pat the steak dry with paper towels. (Any moisture on the exterior of the steak must first evaporate before the meat begins to brown.)\\n\\nSeason the steaks generously on both sides with salt and pepper; the seasoning will stick to the surface and help create a delicious crust.\\n\\n![Image 4: Seasoned steaks on a cutting board.](https://www.onceuponachef.com/images/2019/09/How-to-Pan-Sear-a-Steak-2-760x485.jpg)\\n\\nTurn on your exhaust fan and heat a heavy pan over medium-high heat until it\\u2019s VERY hot. The best pans for pan-searing are stainless steel or cast-iron since they can withstand high temperatures.\\n\\nAdd the oil to the pan. You\\u2019ll know it\\u2019s hot enough when it begins to shimmer and move fluidly around the pan.\\n\\nCarefully set the steak in the pan, releasing it away from you so the oil doesn\\u2019t splatter in your direction. It should sizzle. (Use a pan that is large enough that it\\u2019s not such a tight fit or the pan will cool down and your food will steam instead of sear.)\\n\\n![Image 5: pan-sear steaks in skillet](https://www.onceuponachef.com/images/2019/09/How-to-Pan-Sear-a-Steak-3-760x537.jpg)\\n\\nLeave it alone! Avoid the temptation to peek or fiddle or flip repeatedly. The steaks need a few minutes undisturbed to develop a brown crust. (Don\\u2019t worry about sticking; the steaks will release easily when they are ready to flip.)\\n\\nFlip the steaks when they release easily and the bottom is a deep-brown color (usually about 3 minutes).\\n\\n![Image 6: Tongs flipping a steak in a skillet.](https://www.onceuponachef.com/images/2019/09/How-to-Pan-Sear-a-Steak-4-760x521.jpg)\\n\\nContinue to cook the steaks for another 3 to 4 minutes on the bottom side for rare or medium-rare.\\n\\nDuring the last minute of cooking, add 1 tablespoon of butter and a few sprigs of fresh thyme to the pan with the steaks (this is optional but delicious).\\n\\n![Image 7: pan-sear steaks butter and thyme](https://www.onceuponachef.com/images/2019/09/How-to-Pan-Sear-a-Steak-760x551.jpg)\\n\\nIf you are serving the steaks unsliced, transfer them to plates and serve hot. If you plan to slice the steaks, transfer them to a cutting board and let rest, covered with aluminum foil, for 5 to 10 minutes; then slice thinly against the grain. (Resting allows the juices to redistribute from the outside of the steaks; if you slice them too soon, the juices will pour out of them.)\\n\\nVideo Tutorial\\n--------------\\n\\n\\u25ba\\n\\nYou May Also Like\\n-----------------\\n\\n*   [Beef Stew with Carrots & Potatoes](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/beef-stew-with-carrots-potatoes.html)\\n*   [Roast Beef Tenderloin with Red Wine Sauce](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/roast-beef-tenderloin-wine-sauce.html)\\n*   [Restaurant-Style Pan-Seared Salmon](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/restaurant-style-pan-seared-salmon.html)\\n*   [Red Wine Braised Short Ribs](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/red-wine-braised-short-ribs.html)\\n*   [Steak Au Poivre](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/steak-au-poivre.html)\\n*   [Wedge Salad with Blue Cheese Dressing](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/wedge-salad.html)\\n\\n*   [Recipe](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/how-to-cook-steak-on-the-stovetop.html#tabrecipe)\\n*   [Comments (216)](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/how-to-cook-steak-on-the-stovetop.html#tabreviews)\\n*   [Add Comment](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/how-to-cook-steak-on-the-stovetop.html#tabaddreview)\\n\\nPan-Seared Steaks\\n-----------------\\n\\n### Ingredients\\n\\n*   2(12-oz) New York strip or ribeye steaks or 4 (6-oz) filet mignons, about 1\\u00bd inches thick\\n*   1 heaping teaspoon kosher salt\\n*   \\u00bd teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\\n*   2 tablespoons vegetable oil\\n*   1 tablespoon unsalted butter\\n*   A few sprigs fresh thyme leaves\\n\\n### Instructions\\n\\n1.

Migas literally translates to \\u201ccrumbs,\\u201d as the egg recipe is meant to be a way to use up stale tortillas.   \\n\\n*   Photograph by Guang Xu\\n\\n[Creamy Crab and Boursin Omelet ------------------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/creamy-crab-and-boursin-omelet-recipe)If you\\u2019ve never had creamy Boursin Garlic and Fine Herbs cheese\\u2014do those people exist?\\u2014then we suggest you run to the store immediately, and then make this omelet.   \\n*   Photo by Laura Murray, food styling by Susie Theodorou\\n\\n[Golden Fried Rice With Salmon and Furikake ------------------------------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/golden-fried-rice-with-salmon-and-furikake)Egg yolks are the secret to superb (and golden) [fried rice](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/kimchi-fried-rice-with-broccoli); they help the grains maintain their structure and stay separate from one another instead of becoming a mushy mass.   \\n\\n*   Photograph by Emma Fishman, food styling by Kendra Vaculin\\n\\n[Baked Eggs and Greens in Harissa Tomato Sauce ---------------------------------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/baked-eggs-and-greens-in-harissa-tomato-sauce)Croutons need not be saved exclusively for salads. In this egg recipe, hand-torn hunks of country-style bread, crisped in a skillet, bring crunch while also soaking up tomato sauce and yogurt.   \\n*   Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate Buckens\\n\\n[French Toast Casserole ----------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-french-toast-casserole)French toast meets breakfast casserole in this hands-off entertaining brunch dish. This recipe is all about creating a [bread pudding](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-bread-pudding) experience balanced by textural pops of demerara sugar.   \\n\\n*   Photograph by Laura Murray, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Sophie Strangio\\n\\n[Simplest Rosti --------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/simplest-rosti)It\\u2019s not a [latke](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/potato-latkes-104406). It\\u2019s not a [hash brown](https://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/how-to-make-the-best-hash-browns-article). It\\u2019s a rosti, a Swiss dish consisting of grated potatoes and onions held together by sheer will (and a firm press in a hot skillet). Naturally, we put fried eggs on top.   \\n\\n*   Photographs by Emma Fishman\\n\\n[Curried Egg Tartines --------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/curried-egg-tartines)Of course, we had to include an egg salad recipe on the list. If you prefer a more traditional version for your brunch dish, try these [Egg Salad Tartines With Mixed Herbs](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/egg-salad-tartines-with-mixed-herbs), but we find ourselves turning to this curry powder-infused recipe again and again\\u2014and finishing it with loads of fresh chives.   \\n*   Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Food Styling by Pearl Jones\\n\\n[Steak and Eggs With Salsa Verde -------------------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/steak-and-eggs-with-salsa-verde)Steak and eggs is one of those special dishes you indulge in when it\\u2019s most needed, so make it count: Get a nice hard sear on the meat\\u2019s exterior and get those olive-oil-fried eggs real crispy on the edges.   \\n\\n*   Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Pearl Jones, Prop Styling by G\\u00f6zde Eker\\n\\n[Masala Skillet Scramble -----------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/masala-skillet-scramble)Just a little bit of ground cumin, fresh ginger, and finely chopped jalape\\u00f1o take this one-pan dish in a totally different direction from your average diner-style egg scramble.   \\n*   Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Thu Buser, Prop Styling by Sean Dooley\\n\\n[Sheet-Pan Merguez Hash With Fried Eggs --------------------------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/sheet-pan-merguez-hash-with-fried-eggs)How will you take your eggs this morning? May we suggest sunny-side up and placed atop a potato and [sausage](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/slideshow/sausage-recipes) hash, please and thank you very much?   \\n\\n*   Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Taneka Morris, Prop Styling by Gerri K. Williams\\n\\n[Quick and Cheesy Omelet Roll-Up -------------------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/omelet-roll-up)We\\u2019re not concerned with whether or not this flour tortilla roll-up would technically be considered an [egg sandwich](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/make-ahead-egg-and-cheese-sandwiches). We\\u2019re just concerned with how delicious and portable it is.   \\n*   Photo by Alex Lau, Styling by Sue Li\\n\\n[Egg White Chalupa -----------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/egg-white-cholupa)This chalupa has many layers: a crispy fried tortilla, stewed black beans, shredded iceberg lettuce, springy egg whites, hot sauce, cheese, fresh cilantro.\\u2026 Avocado toast could never.   \\n\\n*   Alex Lau\\n\\n[Salad for Breakfast -------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/salad-for-breakfast)We love this salad for breakfast: jammy eggs, salty feta, crunchy vegetables. If you\\u2019re going low-carb, serve it without the crusty bread, but we like to use it to sop up any extra dressing.   \\n*   Photo by Laura Murray. Food styling by Judy Mancini\\n\\n[Cheesy Egg Bake With Sausage ----------------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/cheesy-egg-bake-sausage-squash)When you want breakfast for dinner, make this egg casserole. The recipe is flexible enough to work with whatever veggies you have in the fridge; [winter squash](https://www.bonappetit.com/gallery/winter-squash-recipes) works in colder months, but zucchini and feta would be a nice summertime version.   \\n\\n*   Photo by Chelsie Craig, styling by Judy Mancini\\n\\n[Eggs Benedict for a Crowd -------------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/eggs-benedict-for-a-crowd)If you\\u2019ve ever tried to make classic eggs Benedict for a crowd, you\\u2019ll know that it\\u2019s, well, challenging. (The hollandaise sauce alone...) And while it\\u2019s true that we\\u2019ve never heard \\u201ceggs Benedict\\u201d and \\u201ceasy breakfast\\u201d used in the same sentence, we figured out a way.   \\n*   Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Judy Kim, Prop Styling by Stephanie De Luca\\n\\n[Bibimbap --------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bibimbap)There is no definitive bibimbap recipe, but the one constant is [rice](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/slideshow/rice-recipes) topped with an array of garnishes. For us, the other nonnegotiable is a fried egg on top.   \\n\\n*   Ted Cavanaugh\\n\\n[Chorizo Breakfast Tacos With Potato Hash and Fried Eggs -------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/breakfast-tacos-with-potato-hash-and-fried-eggs)We recommend olive-oil-basted fried eggs for topping these tacos: You\\u2019ll tilt your skillet toward you so that oil pools at the front edge of the pan, and use a big soup spoon to bathe the egg whites in that oil until they\\u2019re set.   \\n*   Alex Lau\\n\\n[Green Shakshuka ---------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/green-shakshuka)[Shakshuka](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/30-minute-shakshuka-with-yogurt) typically involves eggs poached in a sauce of tomatoes, olive oil, peppers, onion, and garlic, but we love a riff. This version is made green by Swiss chard, serrano chiles, and cilantro. (Bonus: Here\\u2019s another version made with [butternut squash](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/butternut-shakshuka).)   \\n\\n*   Ted Cavanaugh\\n\\n[Hard-Boiled Eggs ----------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/hard-boiled-eggs)Ask a dozen cooks [how to boil eggs](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/easy-peel-hard-boiled-eggs) and you\\u2019ll get a dozen different answers. This is our method for perfectly hard-boiled eggs\\u2014and we\\u2019ve got some tips for peeling too (a.k.a. the only thing about eggs we don\\u2019t love).   \\n*   Marcus Nilsson\\n\\n[Rigatoni With Lemon-Chile Pesto and Grated Egg ----------------------------------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/rigatoni-lemon-chile-pesto-grated-egg)Once you finely grate hard-boiled egg yolks for this pasta, you\\u2019ll come up with all kinds of ideas for the garnish: Use it as a topping for crostini, soup, or steamed veggies.   \\n\\n*   Jenny Rosenstrach, Andy Ward\\n\\n[Spanish Tortilla ----------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/spanish-tortilla)This egg dish begins with potatoes. Slowly cook them along with onions in lots\\u2014we mean one and a half cups\\u2014of olive oil, then save the leftover oil to make mayonnaise (or whatever else you want, frankly).   \\n\\n*   Photo by Travis Rainey, Food Styling by Kaitlin Wayne, Prop Styling by Alexandra Massillon\\n\\n[Scotch Eggs -----------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/homemade-scotch-eggs)This egg recipe isn\\u2019t so much a breakfast idea as it is a meaty, salty, crunchy [drinking snack](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/peanut-drinking-snack) idea. Scotch eggs, the gastropub staple, are simply meant for a pint of beer.   \\n\\n[![Image 3](https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/67ffd05fc2e441074f14e7c3/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined)](https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/joe-sevier)\\n\\nJoe joined the Bon App\\u00e9tit team in 2022 after climbing the editorial ranks for a few years at Cond\\u00e9 Nast\\u2019s other food publication, Epicurious.

Very easy, tasty and impressive to serve. (It\\u2019s a substantial meal though - brunch or lunch, rather than breakfast IMHO.) The salsa side and halloumi topping are inspired. My other comments are that I overcooked the fried egg (obviously due to amateur equipment!!!), so will begin frying after the crumpets next time; and I used too much halloumi - I guessed a quarter block I.e. 60g which resulted in a \\u201csplodge\\u201d, but I think 20g will give Jamie\\u2019s criss-cross pattern.\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\n Like \\n\\n 4 \\n\\n Dislike \\n\\nReply\\n\\n![Image 39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVcLFrEsXWQ&pp=0gcJCf0Ao7VqN5tD)\\n\\n### [@brendahowell2148](https://www.youtube.com/@brendahowell2148)\\n\\n[1 month ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVcLFrEsXWQ&lc=UgwJ0B3ZeUdotyYciTB4AaABAg)\\n\\nGee crumpets are the best better than English muffins haven\'t had them for long time!

If you want fluffy, luxurious scrambled eggs in under 10 minutes, you\'re going to want to save this one.", "content": "If sleeping is Heaven, and the frantic late-morning swirl of looking for homework, backpacks, umbrellas, lunches and jackets is Hell, then scrambled eggs for breakfast is the blissful purgatory in between. With dim lights and good food.\\n\\nIn the mornings, my bleary-eyed children wander from their bedrooms across our creaky hardwood floors. They wobble into the kitchen where I\\u2019m either standing at the stove or basking in the glowing light of our refrigerator.\\n\\nOne will reach out and slowly click off the light switches, one at a time, to allow their eyes to adjust to the morning. I hug them and offer them a glass of milk.\\n\\nWhile my daughter is a \\u201ctoast and sliced fruit for breakfast\\u201d kind of girl, my son is a robust eater. [Pancakes](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_make_fluffy_buttermilk_pancakes/) and [oatmeal](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_make_the_best_oatmeal/) are part of the weekly rotation, but more often than not my son requests scrambled eggs. I\\u2019ve made so many batches in so many ways over the years that I could make them in my sleep.\\n\\nSimply Recipes / Sally Vargas\\n\\nFrench-Style Eggs vs. Fluffy Large-Curd Eggs\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nWhile I value the creamy small curds of French-style scrambled eggs, my son and I both prefer fluffy scrambled eggs rolling with large, pillowy curds. There is something about the way they look\\u2014sturdy, yet soothing\\u2014that helps a person transition into the mad rush of a morning.\\n\\nButter + Milk = The Best Scrambled Eggs\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nI\'ve found that **butter and dairy make the fluffiest, most luxurious scrambled eggs**. The fat in the heavy cream coats proteins in the eggs. This restricts the excess loss of liquid and contributes to fluffier eggs. Without that extra fat, the proteins can release too much liquid, creating a denser scramble.\\n\\nHeavy cream definitely makes the fluffiest eggs, but it leaves a film of fat on my tongue after eating the eggs that I don\'t enjoy. Ultimately, **I\'ve settled on whole milk**, which makes eggs that are rich and fluffy, but still delicate enough to please my palate.\\n\\nSimply Recipes / Sally Vargas\\n\\nTips for Fluffy Scrambled Eggs\\n------------------------------\\n\\nApart from adding dairy, the size of your curds has a lot to do with air, heat, and technique. As long as you keep those three things in mind, your scrambled eggs will be delicious regardless of whether you mix your eggs with whole milk, heavy cream, or water, or use butter or oil to cook them.\\n\\n*   **Think of Michael Jackson and Just Beat It:**Get out a small mixing bowl (yes, even for two eggs) and a whisk\\u2014a cereal bowl and fork won\'t cut it. Aggressively whisk the eggs so they are uniform in color and foamy. This has two functions\\u2014_color and aeration_. Whisking adds air to the eggs, which helps to make them fluffy when cooked. Second, it creates a uniformly golden color. You don\\u2019t want bits of yolk and bits of whites in your final product.\\n*   **Low and Steady Wins the Race:**Start with your pan over medium heat to melt the butter, but then as soon as you add the eggs, reduce the pan to medium low. You want the curds to form gently and slowly in the pan. The same rule applies whether you are cooking two eggs or ten.\\n*   **Get Pushy:**To form light fluffy curds, use a rubber spatula to gently and slowly push the eggs from one edge of the pan to the other.\\n*   **Healthy Shimmer:**The eggs are ready when they are set, but still glistening with moisture. If you cook until they\'re dry, they will be _very_ dry and rubbery by the time you sit down to eat them.\\n\\n**Don\\u2019t overcook your eggs!**I once heard a chef say the best scrambled eggs have the consistency of dog slobber. I understood his point, but the visual is difficult for me to get around. Your eggs are done when they are no longer liquid, the curds are large and clumped together, but they still glisten with moisture.\\n\\nSimply Recipes / Sally Vargas\\n\\nMix-Ins and When to Add Them\\n----------------------------\\n\\n**Anything goes when it comes to turning your scrambled eggs into a larger meal.** Feel free to add leftover meat, vegetables, herbs or cheeses to your eggs. If you create something you hate, you aren\\u2019t out much so go for broke and get crazy. It\\u2019s a low-risk kitchen experiment; eggs are inexpensive and require minimal time commitment.\\n\\n**One of my favorite scrambled egg combinations is sweet corn and chives.** (I\\u2019m from Nebraska so I\\u2019m geographically obligated to work sweet corn into as [many recipes as possible](http://www.scaldedmilk.com/homefood/).) Other possible combinations to consider are sweet peppers and goat cheese; ham, onion, and mushrooms or spinach and tomatoes. I\\u2019ve also been known to add roasted vegetables like cauliflower leftover from the previous night\\u2019s dinner.\\n\\nThere are a few things to consider when adding these ingredients to your eggs. Certain meats and vegetables can discolor eggs (bacon, ham and mushrooms are the first to come to mind). Also, cooking your add-ins along with your eggs could overcook the eggs, making them rubbery and dry, or weepy and watery.\\n\\n**For the best eggs with extras, follow the tips below:**\\n\\n*   **Pre-cook your vegetables** to release extra moisture.\\n*   **Pre-cook meat in a separate pan** to prevent discoloring the eggs.\\n*   **Fresh herbs help brighten the flavor of eggs**, don\\u2019t be afraid to add basil, chives or parsley.\\n*   **Add meats, cheese, vegetables and herbs toward the end of cooking the eggs**, just long enough to mix them in and warm them through. Alternatively, keep them separate and serve them alongside your eggs on the plate.\\n\\nThe Best Pan for Scrambled Eggs\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nThe very best pan for scrambling eggs is a non-stick skillet because the eggs will slide easily without sticking to the pan. You can also use a cast-iron pan as long as it\'s well-seasoned (otherwise the cast iron can turn your eggs a greenish shade!). In a pinch, a stainless steel can be used, but use some extra butter or oil to prevent the eggs from sticking too much.\\n\\nSimply Recipes / Sally Vargas\\n\\nMake-Ahead or Frozen Scrambled Eggs\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nAccording to the American Egg Council, you can crack and mix the eggs together up to two days in advance and store them in the refrigerator without quality suffering. Wait to add the salt, cream, or milk until the day you make them.\\n\\nWhen I go camping with my family, I often crack one dozen eggs into a Ball jar and pack it in the cooler. It makes getting breakfast ready a breeze, and I don\\u2019t have to worry about delicate egg shells jostling around in a cooler.\\n\\nOnce cooked, scrambled eggs are best eaten immediately or at least the same day, but they will keep in the fridge for three to four days.\\n\\n*   **To reheat refrigerated scrambled eggs**, melt some butter in a pan over medium low heat. Add the eggs; they will likely clump together. After the eggs have been in the pan for a minute, gently press on them with the back of a rubber spatula so the curds split up into smaller groups. Turn them around in the pan to coat the curds in butter and warm them through. Two eggs should take about three minutes to warm through on the stove top. The texture isn\\u2019t quite the same as freshly made, but they are still delicious.\\n*   **You can also freeze scrambled eggs**. People do it all the time with quiche, egg cups, and homemade egg and sausage sandwiches. I have never personally frozen scrambled eggs on their own, but [this website](https://chilieveryday.com/can-you-freeze-scrambled-eggs/#How-Long-Does-Frozen-Scrambled-Eggs-Keep.) provides step by step instructions how to freeze and thaw scrambled eggs.\\n\\nMore Ways to Enjoy Scrambled Eggs\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n*   [Joe\'s Special (Scrambled Eggs with Spinach, Beef, and Mushrooms)](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/joes_special_scrambled_eggs_with_spinach_beef_and_mushrooms/)\\n*   [Chinese Tomato Egg](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/chinese-tomato-egg-recipe-7562056)\\n*   [Scrambled Eggs with Kale and Mozzarella](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/scrambled_eggs_with_kale_and_mozzarella/)\\n*   [Chorizo and Eggs](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/chorizo_and_eggs/)\\n\\nThese eggs look as good piled high on a piece of toast as they do alongside sausage and hash browns or saut\\u00e9ed spinach and avocado.\\n\\nIf using other ingredients, make sure they are fully cooked before adding them to the eggs.\\n\\nCook Mode (Keep screen awake)\\n\\n*   1/2 tablespoon butter\\n\\n*   2 large eggs\\n\\n*   1 tablespoon whole milk\\n\\n*   1/8 teaspoon salt\\n\\n*   Fresh cracked pepper\\n\\n*   Mix-ins, like leftover meat, cooked vegetables, cheese, or herbs\\n\\n1.   Melt the butter:\\n\\nMelt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat.\\n\\n2.   Whisk the eggs:\\n\\nCrack two eggs into a small mixing bowl. Add milk and salt. Aggressively whisk the mixture until it is uniform in color, texture, and slightly foamy. You want the whites and yolks fully combined.\\n\\nSimply Recipes / Sally Vargas\\n\\n3.   Scramble the eggs:\\n\\nAdd the eggs to hot skillet and immediately reduce the heat to medium low. Use a rubber spatula to push the eggs from one end of the skillet to the other.\\n\\nContinue doing this, gently and slowly, always pushing the cooked eggs from the bottom of the skillet and allowing the uncooked egg to take its place.\\n\\nWhen the eggs are mostly cooked, but look fairly wet with what looks like thick liquidy egg around the curds, slowly fold the eggs into itself one or two times. You want to bring the eggs together, kind of like a loose ball of dough. Add any cheese, meat or vegetables at this time.\\n\\nSimply Recipes / Sally Vargas\\n\\n4.   Serve immediately:\\n\\nRemove eggs from pan when the eggs are set but still glisten with moisture, and transfer to a plate. Finish with freshly cracked pepper. Garnish with fresh herbs, if using.\\n\\n**Did you enjoy this recipe?

You all have been asking for more simple and delicious recipes that come together fast and have minimal ingredients. This garlic butter steak recipe is so satisfying and will impress your entire family.\\n\\nThe BEST Pan-Seared Steak\\n-------------------------\\n\\nThis 20-minute recipe is done on the stovetop in one pan (no need to finish it in the oven). This is one of our favorite steak recipes and we make it year-round because it\\u2019s such a quick and convenient cooking method. That garlic butter is lip-smacking good! Read on for great tips on how to improve , reduce food waste and you will love our ideas for easy meal prep with leftover steak.\\n\\nIngredients for Garlic Butter Steak.\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nIt really doesn\\u2019t get any easier than this and you don\\u2019t need much to make a lip-smacking good steak. We used 2 New York Strip Steaks (pictured below), each weighing 1 pound and 1 1/4\\u2033 thick. Keep in mind a thicker steak will take longer to cook through and a thinner steak will cook faster.\\n\\nWell-marbled steaks will give you the juiciest results. Our favorite steaks to cook on a skillet are:\\n\\n*   New York Steak\\n*   Filet Mignon (Tenderloin)\\n*   Top Sirloin\\n*   T-Bone/Porterhouse\\n*   [Ribeye Steak](https://natashaskitchen.com/how-to-select-prime-rib-roast/)\\n\\n![Image 3: Ingredients for pan seared steak with garlic rosemary butter](https://natashaskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pan-Seared-Steak-728x485.jpg)\\n\\nHow to Pan Sear Steaks:\\n-----------------------\\n\\n1.   **Pat dry** \\u2013 use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.\\n2.   **Season generously** \\u2013 just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.\\n3.   **Preheat the pan** on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.\\n4.   **Sear steaks** \\u2013 add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).\\n5.   **Add butter and aromatics** \\u2013 melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).\\n6.   **Remove steak** and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.\\n\\n> **Pro Tip:** We prefer using a [large cast-iron pan](https://amzn.to/2QZrfw1) for best heat conduction, but a large heavy stainless steel pan will also work.\\n\\n![Image 4: Step by step photos how to season and sear a steak on a skillet](https://natashaskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pan-Seared-Steak-10-728x1092.jpg)\\n\\nSteak Doneness Temperature Chart:\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nA steaks internal temperature continues to rise as it rests, so remove steaks from the pan about 5-10 degrees before reaching your desired doneness. Use this chart to determine steak doneness when testing with an[instant-read thermometer](https://amzn.to/3v3vFsI). For example, if you desire a medium doneness steak, remove it from the pan at 135 degrees F, and it should rise to 140\\u02daF as it rests. The [USDA](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/safe-minimum-internal-temperature-chart/ct_index) recommends cooking steaks to at least 145 degrees.

Once we have our meal plan for the week figured out, we refrigerate what we plan to cook within 3-4 days and freeze the rest. To preserve the quality of our steaks, we vacuum seal since air is the enemy of food. If you don\\u2019t have a [vacuum sealer](https://amzn.to/2wQpRF6), you can also use a freezer-safe zip bag and squeeze out as much air as possible before freezing. To reduce waste, follow these guidelines:\\n\\n*   Refrigerate Steaks (at 40\\u02daF) for 3-4 days from purchase date\\n*   Freeze Steaks for 6-12 months*\\n*   Refrigerate or freeze right after purchasing\\n*   Place in freezer bags removing as much air as possible, or vacuum seal.\\n\\n![Image 8: Vacuum sealed steaks ready for the freezer](https://natashaskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pan-Seared-Steak-2-1-728x485.jpg)\\n\\nSteak Meal Prep:\\n----------------\\n\\nDid you know 40% of all food brought home in America goes uneaten? Some of the things we do to reduce waste are to eat what we have in our kitchen and also to repurpose leftovers. Leftover steak is perfect for meal planning. Cooked beef can be refrigerated for 3-4 days or frozen 2-3 months. We love using leftover steak to meal prep Steak [Cobb Salad](https://natashaskitchen.com/cobb-salad/) in reusable [to-go containers](https://amzn.to/2V3EM79). Here are some more great ideas for using up leftover steak:\\n\\n*   Dice or thinly slice cooked steak for tacos or Steak [Fajitas](https://natashaskitchen.com/shrimp-fajitas/)\\n*   Whip up some easy [Cheesesteak Quesadillas](https://natashaskitchen.com/philly-cheesesteak-quesadilla-recipe/)\\n*   Make a quick [Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich](https://natashaskitchen.com/philly-cheesesteak/)\\n\\nLove Beef?

It quickly became a tradition for my family, and we would go out or grill in in honor of my turning one year older. Once I moved out, the tradition didn\'t stop, and it\'s something I still find myself craving and turning to as my birthday comes around each year.\\n\\nFor me, steaks and birthday celebrations are nearly synonymous, but that doesn\'t mean I _only_ eat steak as a celebration. A big steak hot from the grill on a summer weekend, eaten with my dad for Father\'s Day, sliced up with friends and served in corn tortillas\\u2014a great steak can do it all.\\n\\nBelow, I\'ve gathered up 15 of our best steak recipes featuring all of the most popular cuts, from strip steak to ribeye, skirt and flank steak to tri-tip. Whether you make them on the grill or in your kitchen, for a celebration or just another beautiful day of life, these recipes are a treat, so enjoy!\\n\\n*   [Skirt Steak with Avocado Chimichurri](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/skirt_steak_with_avocado_chimichurri/)\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n![Image 9: Quick and Easy weeknight skirt steak sliced across the grain and covered with avocado chimichurri on a white plate](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/thmb/GU9H4JT2xhKuHPkweHc2JonfgJc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__simply_recipes__uploads__2019__08__Steak-Avacado-Chimichurri-LEAD-4-0d42f5f2392040b084fac3f3b6f3c586.jpg)  \\n\\nSimply Recipes / Jessica Gavin\\n\\n[Get Recipe](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/skirt_steak_with_avocado_chimichurri/) \\n\\"Sear for a few minutes on each side for medium-rare doneness.

I rubbed them with meat tenderizer and cracked black pepper, and let them rest on the counter for about an hour. Then heated a cast-iron skillet and threw a little salt in the pan, seared the steaks about 4 or 5 minutes per side until they released from the pan. This gave them a nice browned crust while the inside remained fork-tender. Didn\'t change a thing about the sauce, these steaks were awesome!\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14554/sirloin-steak-with-garlic-butter#)\\n\\nHelpful (223)\\n\\n### Featured Tweaks\\n\\n[Jillian](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/jillian)\\n\\n03/17/2009\\n\\nWow! This is restaurant quality. We used NY strips that came out great. For the butter I used about 1/3 c. with 1 & 1/2 tsp. of minced garlic in the jar, 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder, and 1/4 tsp. dried parsley. I let it get to room temp. and made a paste. I put it back in the fridge while the steaks were on the grill. Once they came off, I let the butter melt over them. \\n\\n[Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14554/sirloin-steak-with-garlic-butter#)\\n\\nHelpful (198)\\n\\n[CSANDST1](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/115553)\\n\\n10/01/2001\\n\\nThis was very good. We don\'t have a grill yet so I seared these on the stove-top with the lid. Got a good crust on the steak and the garlic was tasty. To save on fat I used low-fat marg. I will definitely make this again.\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14554/sirloin-steak-with-garlic-butter#)\\n\\nHelpful (198)\\n\\n[LaTrif](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/2379585)\\n\\n06/05/2007\\n\\nThank you for posting this recipe. My hubby and I found it to be wonderful. I used it on filet mignon for a special occasion and not a morsel was to be found afterwards. I also added chopped fresh chives and parsley to the butter. Just a little tip: During the holiday season, I used a recipe very similar to yours to make refrigerated crescent rolls. After unrolling the crescent rolls flat on a baking sheet, I brushed on a little of a mixture similar to this, and everyone went wild. Of course we had turkey and ham (no need for garlic), and the cresent rolls were a lively surprise & hit. I also tried this on broccoli and it was lucious.\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14554/sirloin-steak-with-garlic-butter#)\\n\\nHelpful (125)\\n\\n[NIQUE](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/126594)\\n\\n02/03/2001\\n\\nDelicious! The only thing I would do differently is use less butter to give it a thicker consistency, about a third of a cup instead of half of a cup. When I made it the second time I did that and it turned out great. Much better than when I used the original recipe.\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14554/sirloin-steak-with-garlic-butter#)\\n\\nHelpful (98)\\n\\n[c\'s treats](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/9183765)\\n\\n10/06/2022\\n\\nThis was absolutely delicious. I halved the recipe which worked great.In order to help tenderize the meat about an hour before cooking the steaks, I placed them in a ziplock bag with 1 tsp cornstarch and 1/2 tsp baking soda making sure to rub the mixture into the steaks. After an hour, I washed off and patted dry each steak before grilling. My family loved it and the steaks were tender and delicious. Thank you so much for this recipe which I will definitely make again. I served this with baked potatoes and steamed broccoli. Yum!\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14554/sirloin-steak-with-garlic-butter#)\\n\\nHelpful (10)\\n\\n[Sue](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/29178581)\\n\\n03/24/2023\\n\\nI didn\'t have a working grill available to me so I cooked this for two in my air fryer using two petite sirloin steaks. I didn\'t use the garlic cloves but followed the rest of the recipe for the sauce. Spread the sauce on the steaks before cooking, and cooked at a preheated 400 degrees for two minutes per side. Paused my fryer and tested for doneness with an IR thermometer. Removed when temp. was rare and let sit for about five minutes while I put the rest of dinner on the table. Added a bit more sauce and served with garlic mashed potatoes and a salad. Yum! I realize that this cooking method is not for everyone, and results might vary, but it worked for me with what I had available at the time. Grilling would be preferable.\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14554/sirloin-steak-with-garlic-butter#)\\n\\nHelpful (3)\\n\\n[PapiGringo](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/5122445)\\n\\n02/08/2012\\n\\nThis was 5 star delicious. I used filet mignon, 350\' grill, lightly brushed with olive oil and a little Goode\'s Mesquite rub, three minutes on each side. Melted about a tbls. of the chilled butter mixture over each resting steak. I did not used the garlic powder, just minced garlic and added a little chopped cilantro. The remaining butter mixture was then melted down and used for a dipping sauce with added grilled shrimp. You\'ve got to try this one, it pays off!\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14554/sirloin-steak-with-garlic-butter#)\\n\\nHelpful (0)\\n\\n[CLindsey](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/8406404)\\n\\n12/20/2011\\n\\nDelicious! I marinated my steaks in Dale\'s Seasoning first, seared on the stove top in an iron skillet for 2 minutes on each side over high heat. Then, transferred the steaks to a very hot oven for 6 minutes. Poured the garlic butter over the steaks, wrapped in foil, and let rest for 5 minutes. Will make over and over again!\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14554/sirloin-steak-with-garlic-butter#)\\n\\nHelpful (24)\\n\\n[Donna](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/12725618)\\n\\n02/08/2017\\n\\nMy family loves this recipe, I\'m making it again for the 2nd time tonight. I put under a low broiler for 4-5 minutes each side and add sliced onions underneath the steaks. I baste a couple times with the garlic butter. As someone else suggested, you do need to saute the garlic in a little butter until it\'s soft and cooked, then add in the remaining butter. Delicious!\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14554/sirloin-steak-with-garlic-butter#)\\n\\nHelpful (1)\\n\\n[RainbowJewels](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/rainbowjewels)\\n\\n11/23/2015\\n\\n![Image 20: User Photo Upload](https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F1056727.jpg&w=150&c=sc&poi=face&q=60&orient=true)\\n\\nI don\'t usually buy sirloin steak, but my local warehouse store had fresh bulk packages on sale for a really good price, so I went ahead and got some. This recipe is really great. I did take the suggestion that another reviewer made, and I sauteed the minced garlic in about 2 Tbsp of butter just until caramelized, then I removed from head and added the additional butter and stirred until it was all melted together. I also decreased the garlic powder by half and just added in an additional clove of fresh. I served these with broccoli and some awesome Ore-Ida Simply Wedges Garlic & Herb potatoes and it made a wonderful dinner that I will definitely make again.\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14554/sirloin-steak-with-garlic-butter#)\\n\\nHelpful (2)\\n\\n701 Reviews Sort\\n\\nsort Reviews \\n\\nMost Helpful \\n\\nMost Positive \\n\\nLeast Positive \\n\\nNewest \\n\\n Cancel  Apply \\n\\n Filter (0) \\n\\nfilter Reviews \\n\\n By rating \\n\\n- [x] 5 star \\n\\n- [x] 4 star \\n\\n- [x] 3 star \\n\\n- [x] 2 star \\n\\n- [x] 1 star \\n\\n By type \\n\\n- [x] With photo \\n\\n Cancel  Apply \\n\\n[Stephanie Dykman](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/24872145)\\n\\n05/19/2025\\n\\nEasy to follow Great flavors\\n\\nYummy!\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14554/sirloin-steak-with-garlic-butter#)\\n\\nHelpful (0)\\n\\nAllrecipes Member\\n\\n04/14/2025\\n\\nI did not use the grill or stove with this recipe.

Indeed, pan-seared steaks have several distinct advantages over grilled steaks\\u2014enough that there are times when given the two choices, I\'ll choose pan-seared just for the sake of it. While grilling will get you a rapid-fire crust on your steak with all those delightfully crisp, on-the-verge-of-burnt bits and a good smoky flavor, I find that the even golden brown crust you can develop in a hot cast-iron pan really accentuates the flavor of the beef itself, letting it shine. On top of that, pan-searing affords you the opportunity to add your own flavorings in the form of aromatics.\\n\\nSerious Eats / Julia Estrada\\n\\nOf course, you gotta know how to do it before you can git \'er done.\\n\\nHow to Pan-Sear Steaks\\n----------------------\\n\\nWhen I\'ve got plenty of time to kill, I occasionally employ a low-and-slow cooking method, such as[sous vide](https://www.seriouseats.com/food-lab-complete-guide-to-sous-vide-steak), or perhaps the reverse sear method I developed at _Cook\'s Illustrated_ in which you start the steak in a very low oven and finish it off on the stovetop.\\n\\nBut you know what happens 99% of the time? I\'ve got a steak, I want to get it on the table, and I don\'t want to fuss with it. After all, a steak is a quick-cooking thing. The king of fast food, if you will. I don\'t want to have to heat up a water bath or my oven, I don\'t want to have to wait for hours. That means I want to do it start to finish on the stovetop. Luckily, this is very easy to do.\\n\\n**The TL/DR version:**start with a good, thick, well-marbled steak. Season it well. Sear it in hot oil in cast iron, flipping as often as you\'d like. Add butter and aromatics. Keep flipping and basting. Rest. Carve. DIG IN.\\n\\nRead on for the long version.\\n\\nWhat Steak Should I Use?\\n------------------------\\n\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nYou can\'t end up with a great cooked steak if you start with a crummy raw steak. For the record, we\'re talking [high-end steaks](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-four-high-end-steaks-you-should-know-ribeye-strip-tenderloin-t-bone) here\\u2014those are the tender ones cut from the loin of the cow that generally command the highest prices at the market.\\n\\nThere are four different high-end steaks that you should know and each one is a little different.\\n\\n*   **Ribeye**, also known as a Delmonico or entrec\\u00f4te,is my personal favorite. It comes with a large, tender eye of meat surrounded by a swath of fat and a cap that comes from the spinalis muscle. This cap is far and away the juiciest, most flavorful piece of meat that you\'ll find on any steak. Some folks might find a ribeye to be a little too rich and fatty. Some folks may well be lacking joy in their life.\\n*   **Strip**, also known as New York Strip, Kansas City Strip, or contre-filet,is similar in texture to that central eye of meat in a ribeye steak. That\'s because it comes from the exact same muscle, just a little further back down along the cow. People enjoy strip steak for its relatively tender texture and good amount of marbling (more on that in a minute).\\n*   **Tenderloin**, also known as filet mignon,is the most tender cut of meat on the cow. When cooked, it has a buttery, almost spoon-tender texture. But what it has in tenderness, it lacks in flavor. As a nearly unused muscle in the cow, the tenderloin generally has very little fat, and almost no flavor to speak of, despite its crazy price tag.\\n*   **T-Bone**, also known as Porterhouse when the tenderloin section is at least 1 1/2-inches wide, is simply a slice of rib with both the strip and the tenderloin still attached.\\n\\nThe Difference Between Prime And Choice\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nAll beef that\'s sold in the U.S. is graded by the United States Department of Agriculture on a scale according to its tenderness and degree of marbling. At the top of the heap is**prime**, which denotes an abundant degree of marbling in a cow under 42 months of age. Only about 2% of the beef sold in this country is [designated prime](https://www.seriouseats.com/beef-shopping-prime-high-choice-steak), and most of that goes to restaurants, specialty butchers, and high-end supermarkets. Below that is**choice**, followed by**select**, which are the two grades you\'ll find in most supermarkets.\\n\\nThe grades continue to go down all the way to**canner**, which generally comes from very old cows with little fat in their tough meat. Luckily for us, you won\'t find that grade in stores. (It\'s reserved for such savory applications as school lunches and dog food.)\\n\\nWhile checking the grade is a quick and easy indicator of the quality of the meat, what you should _really_ be checking for is the degree of marbling\\u2014that\'s the interstitial fat that shows up in white spiderwebs throughout the meat.\\n\\nWhy, you might ask, is marbling important? Two reasons: moisture and flavor. As well-marbled meat cooks, the fat will slowly melt, adding juiciness built right into the meat. Non-marbled meat might have plenty of fat on the exterior, but it doesn\'t enhance the steak in the same way. Sort of like the difference between drinking a glass of chocolate milk or drinking the milk then shooting the chocolate syrup.\\n\\nFlavorwise, almost all of the compounds our tongues sense that give us the thought, \\"Ooh, that\'s beefy,\\" are found in the fat. In fact, if you take the fat out of a piece of beef and replace it with lamb fat, it\'ll taste like lamb. Want chicken-flavored beef? Cook lean beef in chicken fat.\\n\\nIf flavor is what you\'re after,**fat is your friend**. Look for meat that\'s got plenty of marbling.\\n\\nChoose Thick Steaks\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe thickness of a steak is not _just_ about portion control. Without an adequately thick steak, it\'s very difficult to get that contrast between exterior and interior that is so desirable. Thin steaks will tend to overcook before they can finish developing a nice crust, even over the hottest fire you can muster.\\n\\nI try to get steaks that are at least an inch and a half thick, if not two inches. This does mean that each steak ends up weighing in at between 12 ounces and a pound\\u2014that\'s big, even for someone with a big appetite for red meat. But remember this:**It\'s better to cook one large steak for every two people than to cook two smaller steaks.** Learn how to share.\\n\\nDry-Aged vs Wet-Aged Meat\\n-------------------------\\n\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nThere are two types of aging. So-called**wet-aged**meat is meat that has been placed in a vacuum-sealed bag and allowed to rest for a few weeks (usually while in transit from packing plant to distributor to supermarket). A wet-aged steak shows some improvement over a standard non-aged steak in terms of tenderness\\u2014there are enzymes present in the meat that will break down tough connective tissue over time.\\n\\n**Dry-aged**meat is meat that has been stored in a temperature and humidity-controlled room for anywhere from a week and up to 10 weeks or longer. During this time, three things happen:\\n\\n*   **Moisture loss**. A dry-aged piece of beef can lose up to around 30% of its initial volume in water loss, which concentrates its flavor.\\n*   **Tenderization**occurs when enzymes naturally present in the meat act to break down some of the tougher muscle fibers.\\n*   **Flavor change**is probably the most relevant. Due to numerous reasons including enzymatic and bacterial action, properly dry-aged meat will develop deep nutty, cheesy aromas.\\n\\nWhether you want dry-aged meat or not is a matter of personal choice. I personally love the funky, blue cheese notes of a very old dry-aged steak and am willing to shell out the extra 20 to 25% it costs. Others prefer the cleaner flavor of fresh beef.\\n\\nBone-In or Boneless?\\n--------------------\\n\\nTalk to most chefs and they\'ll tell you that it\'s always better to cook meat with the bone-in because it adds flavor. I\'ve always been pretty skeptical of this one for a number of reasons. First of all, the exterior of a bone does not have much flavor in it at all\\u2014you have to dig down into the marrow to get at it (just ask my dogs). Secondly, meat muscle fibers are pretty tough customers when it comes to allowing molecules to move around within them.\\n\\nIf an overnight marinade can only penetrate meat by a few millimeters, it\'s a fat chance that flavor from a relatively flavorless bone is going to make much difference.\\n\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nIndeed, I have tested this with prime rib roasts. One I roasted bone-in, another I removed the bone and tied it back on, a third I removed the bone and tied it back on with a layer of aluminum foil in between (to completely prevent any potential transfer of flavor), and the fourth I roasted boneless.\\n\\nAll three of the roasts with bones attached in some way were indistinguishable from each other in both texture and flavor,so there\'s that myth smashed for ya. On the other hand, the boneless roast _did_ come out a little dryer in the specific region where the bone was missing. Really, a bone accomplishes two things: It prevents some moisture loss by reducing the surface area of a steak, and it keeps that section of the steak from overcooking by acting as an insulator. Ok, three things if you count looking-really-awesome as an accomplishment.\\n\\nI personally still go with bone-in cuts when I have the option because I enjoy chewing the crispy bits of fat around the bone, but don\'t let anyone force you to do it if you aren\'t interested.\\n\\nWith pan-seared steaks, bones pose another problem. As the meat heats, it contracts a bit, so while the meat of a raw, cut steak may be flush with the bone, as soon as you start cooking it, it shrinks away, causing the bone to protrude. This, in turn, elevates the meat from the pan, making it difficult to brown the areas of meat directly around the bone.\\n\\nBut there is a solution to this:basting. That is, pouring hot fat over the meat as it cooks. We\'ll get back to that in a moment.\\n\\nTips For Pan-Seared Steak\\n-------------------------\\n\\n### Salt it Well\\n\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nShould you salt your meat right before cooking, well before cooking, or how about after cooking? This is another point of contention amongst home cooks and chefs alike, and one of the ones for which steakhouse-methods often get cited as evidence. At (most) steakhouses, they salt the steak right before throwing it on the grill or under the broiler, so that must be the best way to do it at home, right?\\n\\nWell, consider that at a steakhouse, when a customer places an order for that giant c\\u00f4te du bouef, It\'s gonna take a _minimum_ of 20 minutes to get it to medium rare in the very center. That\'s a lot of minutes in waiting-at-a-restaurant-for-your-food-to-come time.**They salt right before cooking because they don\'t have the time to let the meat sit after salting.**\\n\\nTruth of the matter is that you should salt your meat at least 40 minutes before it hits the pan. When the salt first hits a steak, it sits on the surface. Through the process of osmosis, it\'ll slowly draw liquid out of the meat, which you\'ll see pool up in little droplets. As those droplets grow, the salt will dissolve in the meat juice, forming a concentrated brine. At this stage in the game\\u2014about 25 to 30 minutes in\\u2014your steak is in the absolute worst shape possible for searing. That moisture will evaporate right off, leaving you with a tough, stringy crust.\\n\\nGive it a bit more time, and eventually that brine will begin to break down some of the muscle tissue in the meat, allowing the juices to be re-absorbed, and taking the salt right along with it.\\n\\nWhat does this lead to? Meat that is both better seasoned _and_ more tender and moist when you cook it.\\n\\nAll that said, you will not be destroying anything delicious if you choose to salt your meat straight out of the fridge and into the pan.\\n\\n**Personally, I season my steaks at least a few days in advance**,to give the salt maximum time to work its way into the meat. Why steakhouses don\'t do this is a mystery to me.\\n\\nAnd remember:**USE KOSHER SALT**, not regular table salt. The larger grains of kosher salt (which should more accurately be called \\"koshering salt,\\" as salt itself is always kosher and kosher salt is coarse salt used in the koshering process) are easier to sprinkle evenly with your fingers, and will also draw more initial moisture out of the meat to dissolve than table salt.\\n\\nYou may have heard that it\'s a good idea to let your steak rest at room temperature before you sear it. Here\'s the truth: don\'t bother. A thick cut steak takes a _long_ time to rise in temperature. After half an hour sitting on a plate in the kitchen, the internal temperature of my test models only rose by about 4\\u00b0F (2\\u00b0C). Even after an hour, they\'d barely risen 9\\u00b0F (4.5\\u00b0C), not much of a difference. Cooked side-by-side against one straight from the fridge, the cooking time and eating qualities were nearly identical.\\n\\nSo while it won\'t hurt you to let your steak sit at room temperature, you\'re not really doing yourself any favors (despite what a certain very angry chef may tell you).\\n\\n### Use A Cast Iron Pan\\n\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nA [good cast iron pan](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-cast-iron-skillet) is thick, heavy, and [designed to hold on to heat for a long, long time](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-buy-season-clean-maintain-cast-iron-pans). Once properly pre-heated (that is, smoking hot), a good cast iron pan will practically sear a steak on its own, even if you lift it off its heat source. This fact is critical for the fast searing that is essential if you want to build a thick brown crust without overcooking the interior.\\n\\n### Start in Oil, Add Butter Later\\n\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nWhat\'s the best medium to sear in? Butter, or oil? Some claim that a mixture of both is best, often using the excuse that butter alone has too low a smoke point\\u2014it begins to burn and turn black at temperature too low to properly sear meat in. Somehow, cutting the butter with a bit of oil is supposed to raise this smoke point. Unfortunately, that\'s not true. It\'s because when we say that \\"butter is burnt,\\" we\'re not really talking about the butter as a whole\\u2014we\'re talking specifically about the milk proteins in butter, the little white specks you see when you melt it. It\'s these milk proteins that burn when you get them too hot, and believe me, they couldn\'t care less whether they\'re being cooked in butterfat or in oil. Either way, they burn.\\n\\nWhat all this means is that the best cooking medium for a steak is actually plain old oil. And make sure to use plenty of it so that your steak cooks nice and evenly. I like to use at least a quarter cup in a 12-inch skillet.\\n\\nAdding butter to the pan a few minutes before it\'s done cooking is a fine idea. This is just enough time to allow the buttery flavor and texture (butter is creamier tasting than oil because it has a higher percentage of saturated fat) to coat the meat, but not so long that it will burn excessively and produce acrid undertones.\\n\\nBecause it adds proteins to the mix, butter is a better medium for adding deep brown color to your steak as well, which means that even if your steak is looking a little pale after its initial sear, once you add that butter, it\'ll rapidly take on color.\\n\\n### Flip Often\\n\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nIf there\'s one piece of steak-grilling advice that people seem to get more persnickety about than anything, it\'s that your steak should only be flipped once.\\n\\n_False._ This is another hang-on gleaned from steakhouses in which it\'s simply impractical for a cook to flip more than once given the number of steaks they have cooking on a grill at the same time. At home, you\'re probably only cooking a few steaks at a time, and**it\'s ok\\u2014indeed, it\'s _better_\\u2014to flip your steaks more often.**\\n\\nYou don\'t have to take my word for it either. Famed food scientist and author Harold McGee has been advocating this method for years (and has the data to prove its efficacy). Dave Arnold over at Cooking Issues has[replicated his tests](http://www.cookingissues.com/2009/11/13/mcgee-days-two-and-three-steak-fish-burgers-and-love/), as have I([with hamburgers](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-burger-labs-top-ten-tips-for-better-burgers)). You can quite easily do the test for yourself.\\n\\nBy flipping a steak multiple times\\u2014as often as once every 15 seconds or so\\u2014you not only end up with meat that\'s more evenly cooked, you also cut down on your cook time by as much as a third,_and_ develop a great crust on top of that. This is because with multiple flips, neither side is exposed to intense heat for too long, nor does it lose much heat to the relatively cool air above. It\'s the equivalent of cooking it from both directions simultaneously.\\n\\nThat said, the difference in the end result is not _too_ pronounced, so if you want to leave the steak alone and enjoy your beer, or if you feel the need to placate that annoying uncle who gets visibly angered by multi-flippers, go ahead and use the one-flip method\\u2014it won\'t destroy your steak.\\n\\nSimilarly, using a fork to lift and flip will absolutely _not_ destroy it. To hear people balk at the fork-flippers, you\'d think that a steak is something like a water balloon, ready to shed all its moisture from a single puncture. This is not how a steak behaves. Rather than a balloon filled with liquid, a steak is actually a series of many many thousands of long, skinny balloons filled with liquid. Puncturing a single one will have no effect on its neighbor, and the amount of juice contained in a fork-poke-ful of punctures is small enough not to be noticed.\\n\\nStill, I find it easier to turn steaks with a combination of spatula-and-[tong](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-kitchen-tongs-equipment-review) or spoon-and-tong.\\n\\n### Baste with Butter\\n\\nLift up the skillet and pour butter over the steak, aiming for the paler parts to give them some color. Continue to flip and baste until the steak is approaching finished.\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nBasting is the _real_ key to a perfect pan-seared steak. It performs two different functions.\\n\\nWhen[Ed](https://www.seriouseats.com/ed-levine-5118658)walked by the kitchen in the office the other day and saw the big fat steak I was about to cook, his first question after hearing I was planning on cooking it stovetop was, \\"Isn\'t it going to burn before the inside cooks?\\"\\n\\nAnd the answer is yes\\u2014IF you cook it the traditional one-flip, no-baste way, that is. See, the problem, as Ed pointed out, is that with a screaming hot skillet, you end up overcooking the outside to a black crisp before the center has had a chance to even warm up.\\n\\nA combination of flipping and basting\\u2014that is, spooning hot fat over your meat\\u2014will help cook it more gently, and more importantly,_from both sides simultaneously_, drastically cutting down on its cooking time. A basted and flipped steak will hit its appropriate internal temperature a good 35% faster than a single-flip, no-baste steak. How\'s that for fast food?\\n\\nBasting also performs one more important function: It\'s a perfect way to perform touch-up jobs on your crust. Remember those pale spots that appear around the bones when you try and sear a bone-in steak? Spoon hot melted butter over them, and they\'ll quickly color in.\\n\\nThe easiest way to baste is to tilt your pan slightly so that hot butter collects near the handle, then use a spoon to pour it over the top of the steak.\\n\\nDid I say that that\'s all basting does? There\'s one more function: distributing flavor from your aromatics. After the butter is melted, I add a handful of herbs such as thyme or rosemary, along with some sweet alliums like shallots or garlic. They pop and sputter, releasing their aromas and rapidly infusing the fat with their flavor. When you baste, you\'re adding that aroma with each spoonful.\\n\\n### Use A Thermometer\\n\\nI can\'t possibly emphasize this one enough. Use a thermometer! Use a thermometer!**USE A THERMOMETER!**\\n\\nYes, you may look a bit less macho when you whip out a nifty[Thermapen](https://www.seriouseats.com/why-do-i-need-an-instant-read-thermometer-let-me-count-the-reasons)from your back pocket, swing out the slender probe and insert it gently into the very center of your steak to register a reading, but believe me: Perfectly cooked meat will earn you more praise and appreciation than macho posturing any day of the week.\\n\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nI like my steaks at around 130\\u00b0F (54\\u00b0C)\\u2014the medium-rare point. Many folks like their steaks rare, but to me, that\'s a waste of a good, well-marbled cut of beef. You want your fat to be warm enough that it starts melting a bit, lubricating your meat and adding flavor and juice to every bite. With meat that\'s too rare, the fat remains solid. You end up with all the calories and not nearly as much flavor.\\n\\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum with medium-well to well-done meat, not only have the juices been squeezed dry like water from a sponge, but the liquefied fat has already bought itself a one-way ticket to the bottom of your grill.\\n\\n**Remember: Thick steaks will continue to rise in temperature after you pull them off of the grill.** Heat from the exterior layers will travel in as your steak rests. Make sure to pull it off the grill a good five degrees before you reach your final target.\\n\\n**_But what if I don\'t have a thermometer?_**\\n\\nI get it. Thermapens are pretty expensive. With the amount of use mine gets (pretty much every time I cook), it\'s worth the price. There are also now [more affordable options on the market that do almost as good of a job](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-inexpensive-thermometer-review). But what if you\'re stuck in the woods with no thermometer in hand? Is there anything you can do?\\n\\n**Yes: Just go ahead and cut the sucker open to take a peek.**\\n\\nEven slicing into the steak won\'t release too many juices.\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nI _know_ that everyone tells you you shouldn\'t poke the meat lest you \\"risk losing valuable juices,\\" but honestly, [the loss is not much](https://www.seriouseats.com/perfect-pan-seared-steaks-recipe). Certainly not enough for you to notice once the steak is done. And given the alternative (overcooked meat that _will_ have lost a noticeable amount of juice), it\'s the best alternative out there.\\n\\n### Rest Before Slicing\\n\\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\n\\nSince I last wrote about resting your meat, there have been some questions called as to the validity of the science behind it. Here is the prevalent theory as to why resting your steak is important (pulled from[an older article of mine](https://www.seriouseats.com/tips-for-grilling-season-meat)):\\n\\n> As the steak cooks, the muscle fibers on its exterior tighten, squeezing juices out of its surface. This creates an imbalance of juice in its interior, with most of the liquid being concentrated at the center of the meat. If you cut the steak open as soon as it comes off the grill, the juice has only one place to go\\u2014onto your plate. On the other hand,allow the steak to rest until its temperature has normalized,and the juices will distribute themselves more evenly throughout its interior. Cut the steak open, and the juice stays put exactly where it\'s supposed to be: in the meat.\\n\\nHowever, [Nathan Myhrvold](https://modernistcuisine.com/about/nathan/) of the James Beard Best Cookbook winner _Modernist Cuisine_ says otherwise. His claim is that it\'s not so much about redistribution of moisture, but that it\'s about the relative viscosity of hot versus cool liquids. The juices stay in place because they\'ve managed to thicken up a bit as they cool.\\n\\nIn either case, the fact remains:Resting your meat works.I recommend resting your steak until its internal temperature drops to about five degrees below its maximum temperature. (That is, serve a medium-rare steak at 125\\u00b0F (52\\u00b0C), or a medium steak at 135\\u00b0F (57\\u00b0C)).\\n\\n### December 2012"}, {"title": "The Best Steak You\'ll Ever Make (Restaurant-Quality) | Epicurious 101", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9hUGbg0Ljo", "snippet": "In this edition of Epicurious 101, professional chef and culinary instructor Frank Proto demonstrates how to make the best steak at home.

One of my many joys of cooking over the years, is teaching novice chefs, the basics. Training line-cooks and such. I used to be a music instructor. So, teaching (apparently) is in my blood. This was a beautiful demonstration.

Plus, it\'s super easy to throw together in minutes.\\n\\nWhy Marinate a Steak?\\n---------------------\\n\\nMarinating a steak before cooking serves two purposes: It helps tenderize the meat and adds just the right amount of flavor. Some top-quality steaks can go without a marinade, since they\'re already full of meaty flavor and, with the right prep, end up juicy and tender without any help from a marinade. Budget-friendly steaks, however, benefit tremendously from marination. You\'ll be shocked at the difference a good marinade makes!\\n\\n### Steak Marinade Ingredients\\n\\nThese are the ingredients you\'ll need to make homemade steak marinade \\u2014 you may already have most of the ingredients you\'ll need:\\n\\n**\\u00b7 Oil**: This top-rated steak marinade recipe starts with olive oil, which keeps the meat nice and moist.\\n\\n**\\u00b7 Sauces**: You\'ll need Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce. Hot sauce is optional, but it\'s a great addition for people who appreciate a little heat.\\n\\n**\\u00b7 Lemon juice**: The acidity from the lemon juice cuts through the other flavors, adding welcome brightness. The acid also helps tenderize the meat even further.\\n\\n**\\u00b7 Spices and seasonings**: This flavorful marinade is seasoned with dried basil, garlic powder, dried parsley flakes, white pepper, and minced garlic.\\n\\nHow to Make Homemade Steak Marinade\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nTo make this steak marinade recipe at home, simply blend all the ingredients together. That\'s it! You\'ll find the full, step-by-step recipe with more detailed instructions below.\\n\\nHow Long to Marinate a Steak?\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nHow long to marinate your steak depends on the size and variety of the cut you\'re using.\\n\\n**\\u00b7**Thinner cuts, such as skirt or flanks steaks, should be marinated for 2-4 hours.\\n\\n**\\u00b7**Tougher cuts, such as top sirloin or sirloin tip, will benefit from marinating overnight (about 8 hours).\\n\\n![Image 6: Best Steak Marinade in Existence](https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/SznJC5RPk2RoGomsG9QgsV4t-WU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4537368-2000-5d29dc0518c64986b78c804e32965fd5.jpg)\\n\\nHappyschmoopies\\n\\nHow to Use Steak Marinade\\n-------------------------\\n\\nPour the marinade into a resealable plastic bag. Add steak, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for up to 8 hours. Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Cook or grill steaks to desired doneness.\\n\\n**Tip from**[**Kookie**](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/1542483): Serve your steak with a [wedge salad](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/150738/wedge-salad-with-elegant-blue-cheese-dressing/) to complete the meal.\\n\\nWhat to Do With Leftover Marinade\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nYou may be tempted to re-use the marinade straight from the bag, but don\'t! A used marinade is _not_ safe to use as-is. In fact, the bacteria from the raw meat could make you (and your dinner guests) very, very sick.\\n\\nAll that flavorful marinade doesn\'t have to go to waste, though: You can make it safe-to-eat by boiling the liquid for several minutes. This process will also reduce the liquid, resulting in a thick sauce that\'ll work well with your freshly cooked steak.\\n\\n**Learn more**: [How to Safely Reuse a Meat Marinade](https://www.allrecipes.com/article/can-you-reuse-marinade/)\\n\\nAllrecipes Community Tips and Praise\\n------------------------------------\\n\\n\\"I didn\'t even have the Worcestershire sauce and it was amazing,\\" raves [Juliec](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/11615868). \\"Made the steak a little crispy on the outside and so tender on the inside with a great flavor.\\"\\n\\n\\"I marinated tri-tips for about 8 hours and it was fantastic,\\" says [Kenzie](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/14592683). \\"It made the meat very tender and the flavor was amazing.

Using a steak marinade that has acidic ingredients, such as lemon juice will certainly tenderize meat which can be helpful for pot roast, but a pot roast can easily go from Sunday dinner to Monday\'s trashcan. Too much acid for too long can make the meat mushy. \\n\\nBy thedailygourmet[](https://www.allrecipes.com/allstars-8661275)\\n\\nI have marinated a chuck roast in this for 5 days.

I actually didn\'t add the last 4 ingredients. I didn\'t have parsley flakes & just forgot the pepper. I marinated 4 large Ribeyes for about 4-5 hours and the steaks were delicious, best I\'ve ever cooked. My husband took one of the steaks to work 2 days later and microwaved it for lunch. He was concerned that it might be dry or tough and said it tasted even better. Great recipe.

Marinaded for 6 hours- Turn the Grill on HIGH and with the lid down get the inside temp to 400, (wait untill its up there), sear the meat on all sides opening and the lid to to check and flip. When seared or blackened to desired crust, turn the grill on LOW to cool it, untill the temperature gets down to about 275 or 300. When the grill cools down you can close the lid and cook the meat turning occasionally until the inside temperature of the meat is to the desired temperature. (150 is good) Take the meat out on plate cover with a dish cloth for about 10 min to let the meat rest. Nothing else needed. This is the marinade I chose to use for the tenderloins at the company picnic.There were 3 tenderlions about 3 lbs each, 9 lbs total. I doubled the recipe for the marinade. I used both the minced garlic and the powdered garlic. Don\'t use \'Salt Garlic\'. And for the \'Lemon Juice\' I used \'Real Lemon\' in the bottle. I used \'Black Pepper\', not the white because I like how it crusts. And for the hot sauce I used \'Red Pepper\' powder. The hot pepper boost serves to balances the spices it does not make the meat hot at all.. I used \'Extra Virgin Olive Oil\' because it has more flavor. I wanted to stretch the recipe so I added about 1/3 cup more oil. I split marinade up into three plastic zippos, threw a tenderloin in each one. Marinaded it in the frig, turning the bag over a few times over a 6 hour period.\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/143809/best-steak-marinade-in-existence#)\\n\\nHelpful (32)\\n\\nNobleToast2942\\n\\n09/23/2024\\n\\nFollowed the recipe and we were all delighted! There were multiple comments about how tender and flavorful the meat was. I used skirt steaks and marinated them overnight. Then seared them in a cast iron skillet and cooked them on low in a crockpot for a few hours. Perfect! I also added chopped onion and green bell pepper, which I sauteed in the same skillet before adding it all to the crockpot.

I do. I decided to make two strip steaks and I marinated them in this recipe for 4 hours, then grilled them to medium. I served the steaks and waited for a comment. The comment was \\"what did you do to this steak? It\'s fantastic!\\" When I told hubs that I marinated the steaks, he said to keep doing it, as it was a \\"keeper\\". The only changes I made to the recipe were- 1) I just mixed the marinade up in the zip lock bag and 2) I added 1 tablespoon of a smoky flavored barbeque sauce.

I stuck pretty much exactly to recipe and used it on sirloin. Perfect cut for this marinade. It was the best steak I\'ve ever cooked. I don\'t think blender is necessary. I just put all ingredients in a gallon ziploc and shake it up then add steak. For a single 1 lb. steak I cut the portions in half and it was still more than enough.

Neither of us was particularly confident in the kitchen but we quickly discovered we could manage steaks on the grill. Add a baked potato and we felt like we were fine dining. When you\\u2019re 25 every steak dinner feels like you\\u2019re at a five star restaurant, am I right?\\n\\nI\\u2019ve had fewer opportunities for steak since David\\u2019s alpha-gal diagnosis around 6 years ago (because it means he\\u2019s allergic to red meat). Ya\\u2019ll have never seen a sadder man than David when he\\u2019s surrounded by steak he can\\u2019t have. Now I save my steak nights for when he\\u2019s on business trips. This means it\\u2019s just the kids and I for dinner so I quickly found ways to make steak as easy and kid-friendly as possible. This sheet pan meal absolutely accomplishes that, friend.\\n\\n![Image 2](blob:http://localhost/b3e13bbba1514f9b569e5ae0202985f3)[](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?media=https%3A%2F%2Fthewholecook.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F03%2FEasy-Sheet-Pan-Steak-Dinner-by-The-Whole-Cook-Pinterest.jpg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fthewholecook.com%2Fsheet-pan-steak-dinner%2F&is_video=false&description=Enjoy%20steak%20any%20night%20of%20the%20week%20with%20this%20easy%20sheet%20pan%20meal.%20Tender%20sliced%20steak%20is%20made%20flavorful%20with%20a%20simple%20marinade%20and%20then%20cooks%20in%20the%20oven%20with%20asparagus%20and%20potato%20wedges.%20You%27ll%20love%20the%20taste%20and%20you%27ll%20really%20love%20the%20minimal%20clean%20up!)\\n\\nFor this recipe you\\u2019ll need (full list of ingredients and instructions are in the recipe card below):\\n\\n*   Potatoes\\n*   Sirloin steak\\n*   Asparagus\\n*   Olive oil\\n*   Coconut aminos\\n*   Seasonings\\n\\nTo make this sheet pan meal you\\u2019ll first combine the marinade ingredients and steak.

If you have the time you can also marinate the steak for up to 12 hours. So go with which ever option works well for your schedule!\\n\\nWhat potatoes are best to use?\\n------------------------------\\n\\nI recommend russet, gold, or yellow potatoes for this recipe.\\n\\nWhat size baking sheet should you use?\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nI use a 12 x 17 baking sheet for all my sheet pan recipes. This accommodates a lot of food without overcrowding.\\n\\nWhat is a substitute for coconut aminos?\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nIf you don\\u2019t have coconut aminos you can use a low sodium soy sauce. I personally made the switch to coconut aminos about six years ago because it tastes nearly identical but contains zero soy and a lot less sodium. I have an[entire blog post about coconut aminos if you want to learn more](https://thewholecook.com/what-is-coconut-aminos/).\\n\\n![Image 4](blob:http://localhost/659926dcafebe7d5f163fbc40297dcc3)[](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?media=https%3A%2F%2Fthewholecook.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F03%2FEasy-Sheet-Pan-Steak-Dinner-by-The-Whole-Cook-Pinterest.jpg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fthewholecook.com%2Fsheet-pan-steak-dinner%2F&is_video=false&description=Enjoy%20steak%20any%20night%20of%20the%20week%20with%20this%20easy%20sheet%20pan%20meal.%20Tender%20sliced%20steak%20is%20made%20flavorful%20with%20a%20simple%20marinade%20and%20then%20cooks%20in%20the%20oven%20with%20asparagus%20and%20potato%20wedges.%20You%27ll%20love%20the%20taste%20and%20you%27ll%20really%20love%20the%20minimal%20clean%20up!)\\n\\nHow to slice your potato wedges\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nYou want to start with potatoes that are the same size. Then cut the wedges so that every wedge is uniform in size. This helps them all cook evenly and you won\\u2019t end up with some overcooked or undercooked wedges.\\n\\nLarge potatoes: Slice in half lengthwise. Then slice each half into fourths (also lengthwise). You\\u2019ll have 8 total wedges.\\n\\nMedium potatoes: Slice in half lengthwise. Then slice each half into thirds (also lengthwise). You\\u2019ll have 6 total wedges.\\n\\nSmall potatoes: Slice in half lengthwise. Then slice each half in half (also lengthwise). You\\u2019ll have 4 total wedges.\\n\\nHow to store leftovers\\n----------------------\\n\\nLeftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.\\n\\n#### Potatoes\\n\\n*   \\u25a2  1 lb potatoes\\n*   \\u25a2  1 1/2 tbsp olive oil, extra virgin\\n*   \\u25a2  1/2 tsp garlic powder\\n*   \\u25a2  1/2 tsp salt\\n*   \\u25a2  1/4 tsp black pepper\\n\\n#### Steak\\n\\n*   \\u25a2  1 lb top sirloin steak, thinly sliced, about 1/2-inch thick pieces\\n*   \\u25a2  1 1/2 tbsp coconut aminos, can sub reduced sodium soy sauce\\n*   \\u25a2  1/2 tsp salt\\n*   \\u25a2  1/2 tsp black pepper\\n*   \\u25a2  1/4 tsp paprika\\n*   \\u25a2  1/4 tsp garlic powder\\n\\n#### Asparagus\\n\\n*   \\u25a2  1 lb fresh asparagus, trimmed\\n*   \\u25a2  2 tsp olive oil , extra virgin\\n*   \\u25a2  1/4 tsp salt\\n\\n*   Combine the coconut aminos, salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder in a resealable plastic bag or bowl. Add the sliced sirloin to the marinade, seal the bag (or bowl), and toss to coat. Set aside while you prepare the other ingredients. (You can marinate for up to 12 hours if you prefer.)\\n\\n*   Preheat the oven to 400\\u00b0F. Line a 12\\"x 17\\"baking sheet with parchment paper.\\n\\n*   Slice your potatoes in half lengthwise. Then lay both halves on the cutting board and slice each half 2 to 4 times (depending on the size of the potato) to create wedges.\\n\\nLarge potatoes: Slice in half lengthwise. Then slice each half into fourths (also lengthwise). You\'ll have 8 total wedges.\\n\\nMedium potatoes: Slice in half lengthwise. Then slice each half into thirds (also lengthwise). You\'ll have 6 total wedges.\\n\\nSmall potatoes: Slice in half lengthwise. Then slice each half in half (also lengthwise). You\'ll have 4 total wedges. \\n*   Add potato wedges to prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Use a spatula or your hands to stir and fully coat potatoes. Spread coated potatoes on baking sheet. Place in the oven and bake for 20 minutes.\\n\\n*   Remove potatoes from oven. Carefully flip potatoes and move them so they\'re in a single layer occupying about 1/3 of the baking sheet.\\n\\n*   Spread marinated steak on one third of baking sheet beside potatoes. Add asparagus to remaining one third. Drizzle olive oil on asparagus. Add the salt to the asparagus. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until steak is how you like it.\\n\\nCalories: 327 kcal, Carbohydrates: 26 g, Protein: 30 g, Fat: 12 g, Saturated Fat: 3 g, Polyunsaturated Fat: 1 g, Monounsaturated Fat: 7 g, Cholesterol: 67 mg, Sodium: 927 mg, Potassium: 1126 mg, Fiber: 5 g, Sugar: 3 g, Vitamin A: 923 IU, Vitamin C: 29 mg, Calcium: 69 mg, Iron: 5 mg\\n\\nNutrition information is automatically calculated, so should only be used as an approximation."}, {"title": "The Absolute Best Way to Cook Steak, According to So Many Tests", "link": "https://food52.com/blog/24417-how-to-cook-steak", "snippet": "Learn the best way to cook steak in the oven, on the grill, on the stove, and using sous vide.

Today, she tackles steak._\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nIn 1988, my parents bought their first meat thermometer.\\n\\nThey were in a butcher shop in Huntington, Long Island, and the white jacket\\u2013clad man with whom they were speaking was floored to hear that they didn\'t already own one. They\'d just selected a New York Strip, a rare treat for young journalists paying off student loans, and they were afraid to ruin it. So they\'d asked him: What\'s the best way to [cook this steak](https://food52.com/recipes/13436-bloody-good-steak)?\\n\\n\\"Sear it on the grill, to medium-rare,\\" he\'d said, volunteering some degrees-Fahrenheit benchmark they should use. And then, upon seeing their faces: \\"Don\'t tell me you don\'t own a meat thermometer. You _don\'t_ own a meat thermometer?!\\" He rustled around in his meat surgeon uniform pockets for a [Taylor](https://www.amazon.com/Taylor-Precision-Products-Classic-Thermometer/dp/B00004XSC0) model, and that was that.\\n\\n[![Image 1: 21 Steak Dinner Ideas for Date Night & Beyond](https://images.food52.com/khOhm9ApLsD3ESWDcNWdYTCd99k=/2000x0/a10038b2-6674-43ef-8149-f8b21718c926--2018-0907_roys-3-ingredient-soy-steak-sauce-genius_3x2_ty-mecham_001.jpg)](https://food52.com/blog/9728-8-steaks-for-valentine-s-day)\\n\\n[![Image 2: The Absolute Best Way to Cook Bacon, According to So Many Tests](blob:http://localhost/63adff11dad904a1878c568edbadacdf)](https://food52.com/blog/23779-how-to-cook-bacon-best-way-make-bacon-in-the-oven-skillet)\\n\\nHis advice was, it turns out, just one of many answers. A quick Google search on \\"how to cook steak\\" reveals nearly 300 million suggestions. You _could_ grill your meat. Or, you could cook it in a blistering skillet on the stovetop. You could start it on the stovetop, before transferring it to the oven. You could [make like Bobby Flay](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/perfect-porterhouse-steak) and sear it on the stovetop, slice it, and _then_ broil the other side. There\'s the [reverse sear](https://www.google.com/search?ei=iYFEXZXmCvChgge_pZzABw&q=reverse+sear+steak&oq=reverse+sear+steak&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i71l8.0.0..2478...0.0..0.0.0.......0......gws-wiz.3U2LnWNCoGU&ved=0ahUKEwjVzr2M6eTjAhXwkOAKHb8SB3gQ4dUDCAs&uact=5), and there\'s sous vide, and the list goes on.\\n\\nWhich makes steak a perfect candidate for our [Absolute Best Tests](https://food52.com/tags/absolute-best-tests) series, in which I spend far too much time with one specific ingredient or recipe, in an effort to coax out perfection. (Afterwards, my home almost always smells terrible for days.) Shall we begin?\\n\\nAs always, I identified a few constants to maintain across all of the different methods I tested for cooking a steak. **I chose to cook a Porterhouse steak** that was roughly 1\\u00bd-inches thick, but you can use your favorite cut, whether it\'s a filet, strip steak, or hanger. Before cooking a steak on a pan in the oven, stovetop skillet, [or sous vide](https://food52.com/blog/26466-best-sous-vide-cooker-machine), **pat it dry and season with ample amounts of kosher salt and black pepper**\\u2014with the exception of the grilled steak, which I brushed lightly with oil before receiving its salt and pepper. I also **let the steak come to room temperature for 45 minutes** before its test method (this enables steak to cook more evenly because its muscles are more relaxed. This is a great rule of thumb for most proteins, albeit 45 minutes may not be necessary for smaller cuts of fish and you may need more time for whole chickens or turkeys). **The steak was also consistently cooked in high heat\\u2013friendly vegetable oil** anywhere oil is mentioned, and **unsalted room temperature butter** anywhere butter is mentioned.\\n\\nI prefer a steak cooked to medium-rare (130\\u00b0F), as I know most chefs do. **To test the internal temperature, [I used a meat thermometer](https://food52.com/shop/products/9075-yummly-smart-thermometer?sku=30426).** Once it reached the right temperature, I removed the steak from the heat and allowed it to rest for 10 minutes before slicing (though apparently, this is unnecessary for steak that\'s been cooked via sous vide or reverse sear).\\n\\nNote that, in lieu of a meat thermometer, [there\'s a common touch test](https://food52.com/blog/12895-the-easiest-way-to-tell-when-your-steak-is-done) employed to ascertain whether steak is medium-rare: Use a pointer finger to test whether your meat is as firm as your inner thumb pad when you\'re touching your thumb to your middle finger\'s tip. However, food safety experts advise against this method because the only way to guarantee if your meat has reached the right temperature is by using a meat thermometer.\\n\\n[](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button)\\n\\n![Image 3](blob:http://localhost/63adff11dad904a1878c568edbadacdf)\\n\\nPhoto by Ella Quittner\\n\\n#### Method:\\n\\nAdd a few tablespoons oil to a large cast iron skillet, and heat over a high flame until the oil just begins to smoke. Add the steak and cook for 30 seconds. Flip, and repeat. Do this until a golden-brown crust starts to develop, which takes about four minutes, then add a few tablespoons of butter and continue to cook and flip until until 130\\u00b0F is reached. (This is a loose adaptation of J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\'s Genius [pan-seared steak recipe](https://food52.com/recipes/67882-j-kenji-lopez-alt-s-butter-basted-pan-seared-thick-cut-steaks).)\\n\\n#### Overall Ease & Efficiency of Method:\\n\\nThe stovetop-only method was by far the easiest and most efficient, requiring no special equipment or hot\\u2013skillet transfers.\\n\\n#### Tenderness of Meat:\\n\\nSixth most tender (last place). The meat was chewier in its center than the resulting meat from the other tests\\u2014but, that\'s on a relative basis. It was still thoroughly delicious and pleasant to eat.\\n\\n#### Char:\\n\\nFifth best char, meaning it was decent\\u2014better than that of the sous vide steak (in last place), but not as deep as I would have liked, because the meat came to 130\\u00b0F before it had developed a fully browned crust. This also meant I had a limited time to try to render the fat from its sides, which heated the meat several degrees more as I attempted it. (It\'s possible I could have better controlled for this by adjusting the flame temperature down, but I was worried that decrease would diminish the char as well.)\\n\\n[](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button)\\n\\n![Image 4](blob:http://localhost/63adff11dad904a1878c568edbadacdf)\\n\\nPhoto by Ella Quittner\\n\\n#### Method:\\n\\nPreheat oven to 375\\u00b0F. Add a few tablespoons oil to a [large cast iron skillet](https://food52.com/shop/products/8721-le-creuset-signature-cast-iron-skillet-11-75-inch?sku=28595), and heat over a high flame until the oil just begins to smoke. Add the steak and sear each side (including the thin, fatty sides to render) for two to three minutes each without disturbing, until browned. Transfer to oven with a tablespoon of butter to finish cooking until 130\\u00b0F is reached.\\n\\n#### Overall Ease & Efficiency of Method:\\n\\nThe stovetop-to-oven method is relatively easy, if you remember to preheat your oven while letting the steak come to room temperature. That said, it\'s a pain to transfer a screaming hot skillet mid-cook, and somewhat annoying to keep having to open the oven door to take its temperature. On an efficiency basis, it was a lengthier process than the stovetop-only and the stovetop-to-broiler steaks, about equal to the grilled steak, and quicker than the sous vide and reverse sear steaks.\\n\\n#### Tenderness of Meat:\\n\\nFourth most tender. The meat was chewier than that of the reverse sear, stovetop-to-broiler, and sous vide steaks, a bit more tender than the stovetop-only steak, and tied with the grilled steak.\\n\\n#### Char:\\n\\nThird best char. This test yielded a better char than the stovetop-only, reverse sear, and sous vide steaks, but a lighter char than the grilled and stovetop-to-broiler steak.\\n\\n[](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button)\\n\\n![Image 5](blob:http://localhost/63adff11dad904a1878c568edbadacdf)\\n\\nPhoto by Ella Quittner\\n\\n#### Method:\\n\\nPreheat broiler. Add a few tablespoons oil to a large cast iron skillet, and heat over a high flame until the oil just begins to smoke. Add the steak and do not move for three minutes. Flip the steak, top with a tablespoon of butter, and transfer to broiler to finish cooking (just a few minutes) until 130\\u00b0 F is reached.\\n\\n#### Overall Ease & Efficiency of Method:\\n\\nSimilar as the stovetop-to-oven steak, except a bit more efficient. But, the margin of error is slimmer with this method, vis-a-vis reaching medium-rare. So in that sense, it\'s slightly more anxiety-provoking.\\n\\n#### Tenderness of Meat:\\n\\nSecond most tender, after the sous vide steak. (Somehow, more tender than the stovetop-to-oven steak.)\\n\\n#### Char:\\n\\nSecond best char, after the grilled steak.\\n\\n[![Image 6: The Absolute Best Way to Boil Eggs, According to So Many Tests](blob:http://localhost/63adff11dad904a1878c568edbadacdf)](https://food52.com/blog/24274-how-to-boil-eggs)\\n\\n[](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button)\\n\\n![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/63adff11dad904a1878c568edbadacdf)\\n\\nPhoto by Ella Quittner\\n\\n#### Method:\\n\\nPreheat oven to 200\\u00b0F. Arrange the steak on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, and cook 30 to 35 minutes, until it registers as 115\\u00b0F. Then, take it out and sear it in a hot cast iron skillet in which you\'ve let a tablespoon of oil get to smoking over a high flame. Add a tablespoon of butter with the steak, and sear about 45 seconds on each side, including on the thin edges, until 130\\u00b0F is reached.\\n\\n#### Overall Ease & Efficiency of Method:\\n\\nEqually easy as the stovetop-to-oven and stovetop-to-broiler methods (aka, you\'re required to move a pan of meat around), though it does result in twice as many dirty dishes. Less efficient than the stovetop, stovetop-to-oven, or stovetop-to-broiler steaks; about equally efficient as the grilled steak; and more efficient than the sous vide steak.\\n\\n#### Tenderness of Meat:\\n\\nThird most tender, after the sous vide and the stovetop-to-broiler steaks.\\n\\n#### Char:\\n\\nFourth best sear, after the grilled, stovetop-to-broiler, and stovetop-to-oven steaks. As with the stovetop-only and the sous vide steaks, I wasn\'t able to get as intense a char as I would\'ve liked before it came to temperature.\\n\\n[](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button)\\n\\n![Image 8](blob:http://localhost/63adff11dad904a1878c568edbadacdf)\\n\\nPhoto by Ella Quittner\\n\\n#### Method:\\n\\nPlace the steak in a plastic zip-top bag, and seal using the [displacement method](https://www.sousvideways.com/displacement-method/) (or vacuum seal if you have a set-up). Use the sous vide to cook the steak at 129\\u00b0F for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Then, remove the steak from its bag, and pat it dry with paper towels. Heat a large cast iron skillet with a few tablespoons of oil over a high flame until the oil starts to smoke. Add the steak and a tablespoon of butter. Flip roughly every 30 seconds, until steak has a golden brown sear going on all sides, including the thin sides.\\n\\n#### Overall Ease & Efficiency of Method:\\n\\nNot easy or efficient. Using the sous vide method means you need to purchase an [expensive tool](https://www.amazon.com/ChefSteps-Joule-Watts-White-Stainless/dp/B01M8MMLBI), and cook your meat for much longer (at a lower temperature) than any other method. It also means fiddling with a phone app for the appliance, which is never fun with messy cooking fingers. Plus, you still have to use a skillet for the sear at the end, meaning more dishes than any other method.\\n\\n#### Tenderness of Meat:\\n\\nThe sous vide method, true to lore, delivered the most tender steak. That said\\u2014and it\'s hard to know why\\u2014the flavor of the meat was somehow flatter than that of the stovetop-to-broiler steak.\\n\\n#### Char:\\n\\nSixth best char (last place). I wasn\'t able to achieve a deep enough char, because the meat came to 130\\u00b0F well before the crust was fully browned.\\n\\nFrom Our Shop\\n\\n[![Image 9: Breville Joule Sous Vide](https://images.food52.com/IB_lXvB9frNNpO4aXWl-dGH45T8=/1040x1040/814f56c7-5f17-4f95-9962-d36e6d161d4f--2021-1029_breville_joule-sous-vide_1x1_julia-gartland_470.jpg)](https://food52.com/shop/products/8940-breville-joule-sous-vide)\\n\\n[![Image 10: ZWILLING Enfinigy Sous Vide Stick](https://images.food52.com/NXWrGORzZx5z3F8yXsyd284_rrY=/1040x1040/a685e72b-81ed-4844-a307-679c2cee81b1--2021-1101_zwilling_sous-vide-stick_detail-1_silo_ty-mecham.jpg)](https://food52.com/shop/products/9355-zwilling-sous-vide-stick)\\n\\n[](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button)\\n\\n![Image 11](blob:http://localhost/63adff11dad904a1878c568edbadacdf)\\n\\nPhoto by Ella Quittner\\n\\n#### Method:\\n\\nPreheat grill (I used a [Big Green Egg](https://biggreenegg.com/) and lump charcoal) to 600\\u00b0F. Place the steak on the grill, close, and cook for about three minutes. Open the grill and check on the bottom side, which should have a nice char. Flip and grill the other side another three-ish minutes, until 130\\u00b0F is reached.\\n\\n#### Overall Ease & Efficiency of Method:\\n\\nHaving to buy charcoal and let a grill preheat to a high temperature is a pain. This was way less easy and efficient than the stovetop and oven methods, though still easier and more efficient than the sous vide steak. Also, unlike the sous vide method, if you\'re going to the trouble of stocking charcoal and preheating your grill, you can [make a meal out of it](https://food52.com/blog/10478-27-genius-recipes-for-the-grill) with sides and other proteins.\\n\\n#### Tenderness of Meat:\\n\\nFourth most tender (tied with stovetop-to-oven steak). That said, the grilled steak tasted heads and shoulders above the other steaks, despite being slightly less tender.\\n\\n#### Char:\\n\\nEasily the most charred (first place).\\n\\nFrom Our Shop\\n\\n[![Image 12: Wood-Handled Stainless Steel Grill Tools](https://images.food52.com/ZWZbp8tEVHeE4Iscqwuh0dYANJ0=/1040x1040/682dece3-5502-4835-a321-8bbbc25301db--2021-0407_barebones-living_wood-handled-stainless-steel-grill-tools_fish-spatula_1x1_julia-gartland_250.jpg)](https://food52.com/shop/products/8426-wood-handle-grill-tools)\\n\\nMaybe your friends are coming over in less than an hour, or maybe it\\u2019s the first time you\\u2019re preparing a home-cooked meal for your new partner. You need to know the best way to cook a steak and you need to know now! Long story short, if you have a grill and you can get it really hot, what are you waiting for? The best way to cook a steak is on a grill. There, I said it. Do that. It just tastes better. [Cooking steak on a grill](https://food52.com/blog/10478-27-genius-recipes-for-the-grill) yielded the most charred meat with the absolute best flavor, thanks to the smoky coals. While the meat was not as tender as other methods like sous vide steak and the stovetop-to-broiler method, I believe the flavor and crackly charred exterior makes up for a little chewiness.\\n\\nIf, like me, you\'re a sad city dweller most of the year and don\\u2019t have access to a grill, go for the stovetop-to-broiler for the most efficient method with the charriest char and the most tender meat. It also requires no pricey kitchen equipment (looking at you sous vide). If you have a good cast iron skillet (please tell me you do), that\\u2019s as good as gold.\\n\\n_What method do you swear by to cook the perfect steak? Let us know in the comments._ _This post was updated in December 2021 to include additional cooking tips from our editors._"}, {"title": "How To Cook Steak On The Stovetop", "link": "https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/how-to-cook-steak-on-the-stovetop.html", "snippet": "If you\'re wondering how to cook a steak that rivals a high-end steak house, the key is mastering the simple technique of pan-searing.", "content": "This post may contain affiliate links. Read my [full disclosure policy](https://www.onceuponachef.com/privacy-policy).\\n\\n_Pan-searing is the best\\u2014and easiest\\u2014way to cook a steak. Master this technique to whip up a steak that rivals your favorite steakhouse._\\n\\n![Image 1: Steak in a skillet with butter.](https://www.onceuponachef.com/images/2019/09/How-to-Pan-Sear-Steak-760x551.jpg)\\n![Image 2: Tested & Perfected Recipes](https://www.onceuponachef.com/wp-content/themes/ouac2018/images/tested-stamp.svg)\\n\\nI love the kind of dinner you can whip up without relying on a recipe. Truth be told, good cooking is more about mastering techniques than following recipes, and the best dishes are often the simplest to make. A perfectly cooked steak is a prime example. With just a handful of ingredients and a single pan, you can prepare a steak that rivals anything you\\u2019d enjoy at a high-end steakhouse.\\n\\nThe secret is mastering the art of pan-searing. This classic technique involves cooking the surface of your food undisturbed in a piping hot pan until a crisp, golden-brown, and flavorful crust forms. It\\u2019s the key to building flavor and texture in a dish while preventing sticking and giving your meal a restaurant-quality appearance. Pan-searing is hands-down the best way to cook a steak (it works wonders for [salmon](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/restaurant-style-pan-seared-salmon.html) and [scallops](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/pan-seared-scallops-with-lemon-butter.html), too), and it also happens to be incredibly easy.\\n\\nWhat you\\u2019ll need to Cook Steak on The Stovetop\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\n![Image 3: Ingredients including vegetable oil, thyme, and pepper.](https://www.onceuponachef.com/images/2019/09/How-to-Pan-Sear-a-Steak-1-760x517.jpg)\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWhen it comes to beef, the best candidates for pan-searing are boneless, quick-cooking cuts between one and one-and-a-half inches thick, such as NY Strip, rib eye or filet mignon. (For larger or slow-cooking cuts, like [beef tenderloin with red wine sauce](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/roast-beef-tenderloin-wine-sauce.html) or [beef stew with carrots and potatoes](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/beef-stew-with-carrots-potatoes.html), pan-searing is usually the first step, and then you finish the cooking in the oven.)\\n\\nTo begin, pat the steak dry with paper towels. (Any moisture on the exterior of the steak must first evaporate before the meat begins to brown.)\\n\\nSeason the steaks generously on both sides with salt and pepper; the seasoning will stick to the surface and help create a delicious crust.\\n\\n![Image 4: Seasoned steaks on a cutting board.](https://www.onceuponachef.com/images/2019/09/How-to-Pan-Sear-a-Steak-2-760x485.jpg)\\n\\nTurn on your exhaust fan and heat a heavy pan over medium-high heat until it\\u2019s VERY hot. The best pans for pan-searing are stainless steel or cast-iron since they can withstand high temperatures.\\n\\nAdd the oil to the pan. You\\u2019ll know it\\u2019s hot enough when it begins to shimmer and move fluidly around the pan.\\n\\nCarefully set the steak in the pan, releasing it away from you so the oil doesn\\u2019t splatter in your direction. It should sizzle. (Use a pan that is large enough that it\\u2019s not such a tight fit or the pan will cool down and your food will steam instead of sear.)\\n\\n![Image 5: pan-sear steaks in skillet](https://www.onceuponachef.com/images/2019/09/How-to-Pan-Sear-a-Steak-3-760x537.jpg)\\n\\nLeave it alone! Avoid the temptation to peek or fiddle or flip repeatedly. The steaks need a few minutes undisturbed to develop a brown crust. (Don\\u2019t worry about sticking; the steaks will release easily when they are ready to flip.)\\n\\nFlip the steaks when they release easily and the bottom is a deep-brown color (usually about 3 minutes).\\n\\n![Image 6: Tongs flipping a steak in a skillet.](https://www.onceuponachef.com/images/2019/09/How-to-Pan-Sear-a-Steak-4-760x521.jpg)\\n\\nContinue to cook the steaks for another 3 to 4 minutes on the bottom side for rare or medium-rare.\\n\\nDuring the last minute of cooking, add 1 tablespoon of butter and a few sprigs of fresh thyme to the pan with the steaks (this is optional but delicious).\\n\\n![Image 7: pan-sear steaks butter and thyme](https://www.onceuponachef.com/images/2019/09/How-to-Pan-Sear-a-Steak-760x551.jpg)\\n\\nIf you are serving the steaks unsliced, transfer them to plates and serve hot. If you plan to slice the steaks, transfer them to a cutting board and let rest, covered with aluminum foil, for 5 to 10 minutes; then slice thinly against the grain. (Resting allows the juices to redistribute from the outside of the steaks; if you slice them too soon, the juices will pour out of them.)\\n\\nVideo Tutorial\\n--------------\\n\\n\\u25ba\\n\\nYou May Also Like\\n-----------------\\n\\n*   [Beef Stew with Carrots & Potatoes](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/beef-stew-with-carrots-potatoes.html)\\n*   [Roast Beef Tenderloin with Red Wine Sauce](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/roast-beef-tenderloin-wine-sauce.html)\\n*   [Restaurant-Style Pan-Seared Salmon](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/restaurant-style-pan-seared-salmon.html)\\n*   [Red Wine Braised Short Ribs](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/red-wine-braised-short-ribs.html)\\n*   [Steak Au Poivre](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/steak-au-poivre.html)\\n*   [Wedge Salad with Blue Cheese Dressing](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/wedge-salad.html)\\n\\n*   [Recipe](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/how-to-cook-steak-on-the-stovetop.html#tabrecipe)\\n*   [Comments (216)](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/how-to-cook-steak-on-the-stovetop.html#tabreviews)\\n*   [Add Comment](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/how-to-cook-steak-on-the-stovetop.html#tabaddreview)\\n\\nPan-Seared Steaks\\n-----------------\\n\\n### Ingredients\\n\\n*   2(12-oz) New York strip or ribeye steaks or 4 (6-oz) filet mignons, about 1\\u00bd inches thick\\n*   1 heaping teaspoon kosher salt\\n*   \\u00bd teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\\n*   2 tablespoons vegetable oil\\n*   1 tablespoon unsalted butter\\n*   A few sprigs fresh thyme leaves\\n\\n### Instructions\\n\\n1.

Migas literally translates to \\u201ccrumbs,\\u201d as the egg recipe is meant to be a way to use up stale tortillas.   \\n\\n*   Photograph by Guang Xu\\n\\n[Creamy Crab and Boursin Omelet ------------------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/creamy-crab-and-boursin-omelet-recipe)If you\\u2019ve never had creamy Boursin Garlic and Fine Herbs cheese\\u2014do those people exist?\\u2014then we suggest you run to the store immediately, and then make this omelet.   \\n*   Photo by Laura Murray, food styling by Susie Theodorou\\n\\n[Golden Fried Rice With Salmon and Furikake ------------------------------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/golden-fried-rice-with-salmon-and-furikake)Egg yolks are the secret to superb (and golden) [fried rice](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/kimchi-fried-rice-with-broccoli); they help the grains maintain their structure and stay separate from one another instead of becoming a mushy mass.   \\n\\n*   Photograph by Emma Fishman, food styling by Kendra Vaculin\\n\\n[Baked Eggs and Greens in Harissa Tomato Sauce ---------------------------------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/baked-eggs-and-greens-in-harissa-tomato-sauce)Croutons need not be saved exclusively for salads. In this egg recipe, hand-torn hunks of country-style bread, crisped in a skillet, bring crunch while also soaking up tomato sauce and yogurt.   \\n*   Photo by Chelsie Craig, Food Styling by Kate Buckens\\n\\n[French Toast Casserole ----------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-french-toast-casserole)French toast meets breakfast casserole in this hands-off entertaining brunch dish. This recipe is all about creating a [bread pudding](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-bread-pudding) experience balanced by textural pops of demerara sugar.   \\n\\n*   Photograph by Laura Murray, food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich, prop styling by Sophie Strangio\\n\\n[Simplest Rosti --------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/simplest-rosti)It\\u2019s not a [latke](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/potato-latkes-104406). It\\u2019s not a [hash brown](https://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/how-to-make-the-best-hash-browns-article). It\\u2019s a rosti, a Swiss dish consisting of grated potatoes and onions held together by sheer will (and a firm press in a hot skillet). Naturally, we put fried eggs on top.   \\n\\n*   Photographs by Emma Fishman\\n\\n[Curried Egg Tartines --------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/curried-egg-tartines)Of course, we had to include an egg salad recipe on the list. If you prefer a more traditional version for your brunch dish, try these [Egg Salad Tartines With Mixed Herbs](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/egg-salad-tartines-with-mixed-herbs), but we find ourselves turning to this curry powder-infused recipe again and again\\u2014and finishing it with loads of fresh chives.   \\n*   Photo by Chelsea Kyle, Food Styling by Pearl Jones\\n\\n[Steak and Eggs With Salsa Verde -------------------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/steak-and-eggs-with-salsa-verde)Steak and eggs is one of those special dishes you indulge in when it\\u2019s most needed, so make it count: Get a nice hard sear on the meat\\u2019s exterior and get those olive-oil-fried eggs real crispy on the edges.   \\n\\n*   Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Pearl Jones, Prop Styling by G\\u00f6zde Eker\\n\\n[Masala Skillet Scramble -----------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/masala-skillet-scramble)Just a little bit of ground cumin, fresh ginger, and finely chopped jalape\\u00f1o take this one-pan dish in a totally different direction from your average diner-style egg scramble.   \\n*   Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Thu Buser, Prop Styling by Sean Dooley\\n\\n[Sheet-Pan Merguez Hash With Fried Eggs --------------------------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/sheet-pan-merguez-hash-with-fried-eggs)How will you take your eggs this morning? May we suggest sunny-side up and placed atop a potato and [sausage](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/slideshow/sausage-recipes) hash, please and thank you very much?   \\n\\n*   Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Taneka Morris, Prop Styling by Gerri K. Williams\\n\\n[Quick and Cheesy Omelet Roll-Up -------------------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/omelet-roll-up)We\\u2019re not concerned with whether or not this flour tortilla roll-up would technically be considered an [egg sandwich](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/make-ahead-egg-and-cheese-sandwiches). We\\u2019re just concerned with how delicious and portable it is.   \\n*   Photo by Alex Lau, Styling by Sue Li\\n\\n[Egg White Chalupa -----------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/egg-white-cholupa)This chalupa has many layers: a crispy fried tortilla, stewed black beans, shredded iceberg lettuce, springy egg whites, hot sauce, cheese, fresh cilantro.\\u2026 Avocado toast could never.   \\n\\n*   Alex Lau\\n\\n[Salad for Breakfast -------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/salad-for-breakfast)We love this salad for breakfast: jammy eggs, salty feta, crunchy vegetables. If you\\u2019re going low-carb, serve it without the crusty bread, but we like to use it to sop up any extra dressing.   \\n*   Photo by Laura Murray. Food styling by Judy Mancini\\n\\n[Cheesy Egg Bake With Sausage ----------------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/cheesy-egg-bake-sausage-squash)When you want breakfast for dinner, make this egg casserole. The recipe is flexible enough to work with whatever veggies you have in the fridge; [winter squash](https://www.bonappetit.com/gallery/winter-squash-recipes) works in colder months, but zucchini and feta would be a nice summertime version.   \\n\\n*   Photo by Chelsie Craig, styling by Judy Mancini\\n\\n[Eggs Benedict for a Crowd -------------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/eggs-benedict-for-a-crowd)If you\\u2019ve ever tried to make classic eggs Benedict for a crowd, you\\u2019ll know that it\\u2019s, well, challenging. (The hollandaise sauce alone...) And while it\\u2019s true that we\\u2019ve never heard \\u201ceggs Benedict\\u201d and \\u201ceasy breakfast\\u201d used in the same sentence, we figured out a way.   \\n*   Photograph by Isa Zapata, Food Styling by Judy Kim, Prop Styling by Stephanie De Luca\\n\\n[Bibimbap --------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bibimbap)There is no definitive bibimbap recipe, but the one constant is [rice](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/slideshow/rice-recipes) topped with an array of garnishes. For us, the other nonnegotiable is a fried egg on top.   \\n\\n*   Ted Cavanaugh\\n\\n[Chorizo Breakfast Tacos With Potato Hash and Fried Eggs -------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/breakfast-tacos-with-potato-hash-and-fried-eggs)We recommend olive-oil-basted fried eggs for topping these tacos: You\\u2019ll tilt your skillet toward you so that oil pools at the front edge of the pan, and use a big soup spoon to bathe the egg whites in that oil until they\\u2019re set.   \\n*   Alex Lau\\n\\n[Green Shakshuka ---------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/green-shakshuka)[Shakshuka](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/30-minute-shakshuka-with-yogurt) typically involves eggs poached in a sauce of tomatoes, olive oil, peppers, onion, and garlic, but we love a riff. This version is made green by Swiss chard, serrano chiles, and cilantro. (Bonus: Here\\u2019s another version made with [butternut squash](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/butternut-shakshuka).)   \\n\\n*   Ted Cavanaugh\\n\\n[Hard-Boiled Eggs ----------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/hard-boiled-eggs)Ask a dozen cooks [how to boil eggs](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/easy-peel-hard-boiled-eggs) and you\\u2019ll get a dozen different answers. This is our method for perfectly hard-boiled eggs\\u2014and we\\u2019ve got some tips for peeling too (a.k.a. the only thing about eggs we don\\u2019t love).   \\n*   Marcus Nilsson\\n\\n[Rigatoni With Lemon-Chile Pesto and Grated Egg ----------------------------------------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/rigatoni-lemon-chile-pesto-grated-egg)Once you finely grate hard-boiled egg yolks for this pasta, you\\u2019ll come up with all kinds of ideas for the garnish: Use it as a topping for crostini, soup, or steamed veggies.   \\n\\n*   Jenny Rosenstrach, Andy Ward\\n\\n[Spanish Tortilla ----------------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/spanish-tortilla)This egg dish begins with potatoes. Slowly cook them along with onions in lots\\u2014we mean one and a half cups\\u2014of olive oil, then save the leftover oil to make mayonnaise (or whatever else you want, frankly).   \\n\\n*   Photo by Travis Rainey, Food Styling by Kaitlin Wayne, Prop Styling by Alexandra Massillon\\n\\n[Scotch Eggs -----------](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/homemade-scotch-eggs)This egg recipe isn\\u2019t so much a breakfast idea as it is a meaty, salty, crunchy [drinking snack](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/peanut-drinking-snack) idea. Scotch eggs, the gastropub staple, are simply meant for a pint of beer.   \\n\\n[![Image 3](https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/67ffd05fc2e441074f14e7c3/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined)](https://www.bonappetit.com/contributor/joe-sevier)\\n\\nJoe joined the Bon App\\u00e9tit team in 2022 after climbing the editorial ranks for a few years at Cond\\u00e9 Nast\\u2019s other food publication, Epicurious.

Very easy, tasty and impressive to serve. (It\\u2019s a substantial meal though - brunch or lunch, rather than breakfast IMHO.) The salsa side and halloumi topping are inspired. My other comments are that I overcooked the fried egg (obviously due to amateur equipment!!!), so will begin frying after the crumpets next time; and I used too much halloumi - I guessed a quarter block I.e. 60g which resulted in a \\u201csplodge\\u201d, but I think 20g will give Jamie\\u2019s criss-cross pattern.\\n\\nShow less Read more\\n\\n Like \\n\\n 4 \\n\\n Dislike \\n\\nReply\\n\\n![Image 39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVcLFrEsXWQ&pp=0gcJCf0Ao7VqN5tD)\\n\\n### [@brendahowell2148](https://www.youtube.com/@brendahowell2148)\\n\\n[1 month ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVcLFrEsXWQ&lc=UgwJ0B3ZeUdotyYciTB4AaABAg)\\n\\nGee crumpets are the best better than English muffins haven\'t had them for long time!

If you want fluffy, luxurious scrambled eggs in under 10 minutes, you\'re going to want to save this one.", "content": "If sleeping is Heaven, and the frantic late-morning swirl of looking for homework, backpacks, umbrellas, lunches and jackets is Hell, then scrambled eggs for breakfast is the blissful purgatory in between. With dim lights and good food.\\n\\nIn the mornings, my bleary-eyed children wander from their bedrooms across our creaky hardwood floors. They wobble into the kitchen where I\\u2019m either standing at the stove or basking in the glowing light of our refrigerator.\\n\\nOne will reach out and slowly click off the light switches, one at a time, to allow their eyes to adjust to the morning. I hug them and offer them a glass of milk.\\n\\nWhile my daughter is a \\u201ctoast and sliced fruit for breakfast\\u201d kind of girl, my son is a robust eater. [Pancakes](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_make_fluffy_buttermilk_pancakes/) and [oatmeal](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_make_the_best_oatmeal/) are part of the weekly rotation, but more often than not my son requests scrambled eggs. I\\u2019ve made so many batches in so many ways over the years that I could make them in my sleep.\\n\\nSimply Recipes / Sally Vargas\\n\\nFrench-Style Eggs vs. Fluffy Large-Curd Eggs\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nWhile I value the creamy small curds of French-style scrambled eggs, my son and I both prefer fluffy scrambled eggs rolling with large, pillowy curds. There is something about the way they look\\u2014sturdy, yet soothing\\u2014that helps a person transition into the mad rush of a morning.\\n\\nButter + Milk = The Best Scrambled Eggs\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nI\'ve found that **butter and dairy make the fluffiest, most luxurious scrambled eggs**. The fat in the heavy cream coats proteins in the eggs. This restricts the excess loss of liquid and contributes to fluffier eggs. Without that extra fat, the proteins can release too much liquid, creating a denser scramble.\\n\\nHeavy cream definitely makes the fluffiest eggs, but it leaves a film of fat on my tongue after eating the eggs that I don\'t enjoy. Ultimately, **I\'ve settled on whole milk**, which makes eggs that are rich and fluffy, but still delicate enough to please my palate.\\n\\nSimply Recipes / Sally Vargas\\n\\nTips for Fluffy Scrambled Eggs\\n------------------------------\\n\\nApart from adding dairy, the size of your curds has a lot to do with air, heat, and technique. As long as you keep those three things in mind, your scrambled eggs will be delicious regardless of whether you mix your eggs with whole milk, heavy cream, or water, or use butter or oil to cook them.\\n\\n*   **Think of Michael Jackson and Just Beat It:**Get out a small mixing bowl (yes, even for two eggs) and a whisk\\u2014a cereal bowl and fork won\'t cut it. Aggressively whisk the eggs so they are uniform in color and foamy. This has two functions\\u2014_color and aeration_. Whisking adds air to the eggs, which helps to make them fluffy when cooked. Second, it creates a uniformly golden color. You don\\u2019t want bits of yolk and bits of whites in your final product.\\n*   **Low and Steady Wins the Race:**Start with your pan over medium heat to melt the butter, but then as soon as you add the eggs, reduce the pan to medium low. You want the curds to form gently and slowly in the pan. The same rule applies whether you are cooking two eggs or ten.\\n*   **Get Pushy:**To form light fluffy curds, use a rubber spatula to gently and slowly push the eggs from one edge of the pan to the other.\\n*   **Healthy Shimmer:**The eggs are ready when they are set, but still glistening with moisture. If you cook until they\'re dry, they will be _very_ dry and rubbery by the time you sit down to eat them.\\n\\n**Don\\u2019t overcook your eggs!**I once heard a chef say the best scrambled eggs have the consistency of dog slobber. I understood his point, but the visual is difficult for me to get around. Your eggs are done when they are no longer liquid, the curds are large and clumped together, but they still glisten with moisture.\\n\\nSimply Recipes / Sally Vargas\\n\\nMix-Ins and When to Add Them\\n----------------------------\\n\\n**Anything goes when it comes to turning your scrambled eggs into a larger meal.** Feel free to add leftover meat, vegetables, herbs or cheeses to your eggs. If you create something you hate, you aren\\u2019t out much so go for broke and get crazy. It\\u2019s a low-risk kitchen experiment; eggs are inexpensive and require minimal time commitment.\\n\\n**One of my favorite scrambled egg combinations is sweet corn and chives.** (I\\u2019m from Nebraska so I\\u2019m geographically obligated to work sweet corn into as [many recipes as possible](http://www.scaldedmilk.com/homefood/).) Other possible combinations to consider are sweet peppers and goat cheese; ham, onion, and mushrooms or spinach and tomatoes. I\\u2019ve also been known to add roasted vegetables like cauliflower leftover from the previous night\\u2019s dinner.\\n\\nThere are a few things to consider when adding these ingredients to your eggs. Certain meats and vegetables can discolor eggs (bacon, ham and mushrooms are the first to come to mind). Also, cooking your add-ins along with your eggs could overcook the eggs, making them rubbery and dry, or weepy and watery.\\n\\n**For the best eggs with extras, follow the tips below:**\\n\\n*   **Pre-cook your vegetables** to release extra moisture.\\n*   **Pre-cook meat in a separate pan** to prevent discoloring the eggs.\\n*   **Fresh herbs help brighten the flavor of eggs**, don\\u2019t be afraid to add basil, chives or parsley.\\n*   **Add meats, cheese, vegetables and herbs toward the end of cooking the eggs**, just long enough to mix them in and warm them through. Alternatively, keep them separate and serve them alongside your eggs on the plate.\\n\\nThe Best Pan for Scrambled Eggs\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nThe very best pan for scrambling eggs is a non-stick skillet because the eggs will slide easily without sticking to the pan. You can also use a cast-iron pan as long as it\'s well-seasoned (otherwise the cast iron can turn your eggs a greenish shade!). In a pinch, a stainless steel can be used, but use some extra butter or oil to prevent the eggs from sticking too much.\\n\\nSimply Recipes / Sally Vargas\\n\\nMake-Ahead or Frozen Scrambled Eggs\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nAccording to the American Egg Council, you can crack and mix the eggs together up to two days in advance and store them in the refrigerator without quality suffering. Wait to add the salt, cream, or milk until the day you make them.\\n\\nWhen I go camping with my family, I often crack one dozen eggs into a Ball jar and pack it in the cooler. It makes getting breakfast ready a breeze, and I don\\u2019t have to worry about delicate egg shells jostling around in a cooler.\\n\\nOnce cooked, scrambled eggs are best eaten immediately or at least the same day, but they will keep in the fridge for three to four days.\\n\\n*   **To reheat refrigerated scrambled eggs**, melt some butter in a pan over medium low heat. Add the eggs; they will likely clump together. After the eggs have been in the pan for a minute, gently press on them with the back of a rubber spatula so the curds split up into smaller groups. Turn them around in the pan to coat the curds in butter and warm them through. Two eggs should take about three minutes to warm through on the stove top. The texture isn\\u2019t quite the same as freshly made, but they are still delicious.\\n*   **You can also freeze scrambled eggs**. People do it all the time with quiche, egg cups, and homemade egg and sausage sandwiches. I have never personally frozen scrambled eggs on their own, but [this website](https://chilieveryday.com/can-you-freeze-scrambled-eggs/#How-Long-Does-Frozen-Scrambled-Eggs-Keep.) provides step by step instructions how to freeze and thaw scrambled eggs.\\n\\nMore Ways to Enjoy Scrambled Eggs\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n*   [Joe\'s Special (Scrambled Eggs with Spinach, Beef, and Mushrooms)](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/joes_special_scrambled_eggs_with_spinach_beef_and_mushrooms/)\\n*   [Chinese Tomato Egg](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/chinese-tomato-egg-recipe-7562056)\\n*   [Scrambled Eggs with Kale and Mozzarella](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/scrambled_eggs_with_kale_and_mozzarella/)\\n*   [Chorizo and Eggs](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/chorizo_and_eggs/)\\n\\nThese eggs look as good piled high on a piece of toast as they do alongside sausage and hash browns or saut\\u00e9ed spinach and avocado.\\n\\nIf using other ingredients, make sure they are fully cooked before adding them to the eggs.\\n\\nCook Mode (Keep screen awake)\\n\\n*   1/2 tablespoon butter\\n\\n*   2 large eggs\\n\\n*   1 tablespoon whole milk\\n\\n*   1/8 teaspoon salt\\n\\n*   Fresh cracked pepper\\n\\n*   Mix-ins, like leftover meat, cooked vegetables, cheese, or herbs\\n\\n1.   Melt the butter:\\n\\nMelt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat.\\n\\n2.   Whisk the eggs:\\n\\nCrack two eggs into a small mixing bowl. Add milk and salt. Aggressively whisk the mixture until it is uniform in color, texture, and slightly foamy. You want the whites and yolks fully combined.\\n\\nSimply Recipes / Sally Vargas\\n\\n3.   Scramble the eggs:\\n\\nAdd the eggs to hot skillet and immediately reduce the heat to medium low. Use a rubber spatula to push the eggs from one end of the skillet to the other.\\n\\nContinue doing this, gently and slowly, always pushing the cooked eggs from the bottom of the skillet and allowing the uncooked egg to take its place.\\n\\nWhen the eggs are mostly cooked, but look fairly wet with what looks like thick liquidy egg around the curds, slowly fold the eggs into itself one or two times. You want to bring the eggs together, kind of like a loose ball of dough. Add any cheese, meat or vegetables at this time.\\n\\nSimply Recipes / Sally Vargas\\n\\n4.   Serve immediately:\\n\\nRemove eggs from pan when the eggs are set but still glisten with moisture, and transfer to a plate. Finish with freshly cracked pepper. Garnish with fresh herbs, if using.\\n\\n**Did you enjoy this recipe?
