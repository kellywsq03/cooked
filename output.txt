Almost every hawker centre now has this stir fried dish where you can customise the vegetables, proteins and noodles that go in. You can also choose your spice level and add garnishes like cilantro and peanuts if you prefer. Overall, the customisation of the dish ensures anyone and everyone is able to enjoy it and no matter what it\\u2019s packed with flavour!\\n\\nAnd it\\u2019s not just the chillies that flavour this dish \\u2013 it also includes spices like garlic, sichuan pepper, 5-spice powder and most importantly, hot bean paste. It\\u2019s usually shared between 2 to even more than 6 people sometimes with a huge mega dry pot. It\\u2019s crazy how much people love eating Mala Xiang Guo as a social experience (myself included!)\\n\\nIn restaurants, there are so many delectable dishes to select from \\u2013 you can pick your choice of protein, different types of beancurd, and vegetables. There is really no right or wrong way to construct your bowl but generally if it\\u2019s just the two of us \\u2013 were pick around 4-5 dishes in a reasonable quantity.\\n\\n![Image 2](https://browngirlveganeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/photo1705849696-1.jpeg)\\n\\nI used to be so crazy about this dish once that I swore my future partner had to like this dish if not we were just not meant to be \\u2013 I got lucky that my partner loves it too ![Image 3: \\ud83d\\ude09](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/svg/1f609.svg) However, I always preferred to prepare this dish at home as it was much healthier than ones you find outside (sometimes it\\u2019s loaded with oils and you can\\u2019t really tell if it\\u2019s truly vegan unless it\\u2019s a vegetarian place). My favourite vegan mala dry pot has got to be Green On Earth, Rail Mall \\u2013 you\\u2019ve got to try it if you are ever in Singapore!\\n\\nIngredients You Need\\n--------------------\\n\\n*   **sesame oil** \\u2013 toasted sesame oil is a BIG pantry staple for me and we use this as a base oil in this recipe!\\n*   **hot bean paste** \\u2013 this is a secret ingredient for that flavour in mala xiang guo. Unfortunately, this paste is not gluten free.\\n*   **aromatics** \\u2013 garlic and ginger. You can omit garlic and substitute with hing if you are alliums free.\\n*   **chillies** \\u2013 you can customise the number of dried red chillies depending on the spice level you prefer. Medium spice calls for about 4-5 red chili peppers. \\n*   **shaoxing wine** \\u2013 you can substitute this with rice wine vinegar or regular white vinegar. \\n*   **spices** \\u2013 5-spice powder and ground sichuan pepper\\n*   **sauces** \\u2013 light and dark soy sauces \\n*   **vegetables** \\u2013 you can use any veggies you like but I added lotus root, bok choy, fried tofu, oyster mushrooms, beancurd skin and ramen noodles. \\n\\nThis sichuan-style mala stirfry is what dreams are made of \\u2013 packed with veggies, protein, and a whole lot of spice and numbingness for that authentic taste.\\n\\nPrep Time 5 minutes\\n\\nTotal Time 15 minutes\\n\\nCourse: Main Course\\n\\nCuisine: Chinese\\n\\nKeyword: chinese, noodles\\n\\nServings: 2\\n\\n*   2 tbsp sesame oil\\n*   2 tbsp hot bean paste\\n*   1 tsp minced ginger\\n*   2 cloves garlic\\n*   4-5 dried red chillies deseeded\\n*   2 tbsp peanuts\\n*   1.5 tbsp shaoxing wine\\n*   1.5 tbsp light soy sauce\\n*   1 tsp 5-spice powder\\n*   1 tsp sichuan pepper\\n*   1/2 tbsp dark soy sauce\\n\\n#### Toppings\\n\\n*   8-10 slices lotus root\\n*   4 bunches bok choy\\n*   150 g extra firm tofu\\n*   150 g oyster mushrooms\\n*   beancurd skin\\n*   2 stalks scallions\\n*   1 serving ramen\\n\\n#### Garnish\\n\\n*   toasted sesame seeds\\n*   chopped cilantro \\n*   chili sesame oil\\n*   1 serving rice for sharing\\n\\n*   Cube tofu and pan fry in olive oil until crispy.

Take them out.\\n\\n*   Boil your ramen noodles according to package instructions with that same water. Drain and keep the water.\\n\\n*   To a wok, add sesame oil. Add deseeded red chillies, sliced garlic and saute for a few seconds. Add peanuts and saute for a minute.

It is spicy and numbing, yet you can\\u2019t stop eating it. I\\u2019m sharing how you can easily make ma la xiang guo at home using hai di lao mala sauce and also how you can make your own mala sauce if you choose to.**\\n\\n![Image 1: Easy Ma La Xiang Guo At Home (Spicy Numbing Stir-fry)](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-8.jpg)\\n\\n I remember a few years ago when we were visiting Chicago, my husband found this Sichuan restaurant and we were craving spicy food then and I immediately ordered ma la xiang guo. The portion was HUGE! I mean, HUGE! It was filled with TONS of seafood and meat and oh gosh\\u2026lots of Sichuan peppercorns and the super spicy ma la sauce. I considered myself a person who can really eat spicy food and this ma la xiang guo was off the chart spicy! LOL AND numbing! but we loved it so much!\\n\\n Spicy ma la food sure has caught its trend in Singapore or I should say, outside of China, in recent years. From the spicy mala hot pot and now the dry version of hot pot, the ma la xiang guo! When you eat ma la xiang guo in restaurants, you picked your ingredients, they will weigh them on the scale (yup!) and the cook will fry up ma la xian guo using what you picked! It can cost you quite a bit. I think ma la xiang guo made at home is just as delicious, and the nice thing about it is that, you can use whatever ingredients you have leftover or you can go all out and put in whatever you fancy.\\n\\n**Easy Homemade Ma la Sauce vs Hai Di Lau Ma la sauce**\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf this is your first time making ma la xiang guo, I suggest using the [Hai Di Lau ma la basic stir-fry sauce](https://amzn.to/3dTUko3) (not sponsored). It\\u2019s just so much more convenient and it gives you that satisfying level of spiciness and numbness. I actually use the Hai Di Lau ma la hotpot sauce that I purchased for making hotpot but didn\\u2019t end up using it. They are very similar. You are of course, welcome to use whatever ma la stir-fry sauce you like, you don\\u2019t have to use this brand. For homemade ma la sauce I\\u2019ve tried using [Lao Gan Ma chili crisp in oil](https://amzn.to/3yOLtfv) and then add some Szechuan peppercorns and some seasonings and it actually turns out pretty good too.\\n\\n![Image 2: Easy Ma La Xiang Guo At Home (Spicy Numbing Stir-fry)](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-9.jpg)\\n\\n### MY LATEST VIDEOS\\n\\nnext\\n\\nstay\\n\\nCC\\n\\nSettings Off Arabic Chinese English French German Hindi Portuguese Spanish\\n\\nFont Color white Font Opacity 100%Font Size 100%Font Family Arial Text Shadow none Background Color black Background Opacity 50%Window Color black Window Opacity 0%\\n\\nWhite Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan\\n\\n100%75%50%25%\\n\\n200%175%150%125%100%75%50%\\n\\nArial Georgia Garamond Courier New Tahoma Times New Roman Trebuchet MS Verdana\\n\\nNone Raised Depressed Uniform Drop Shadow\\n\\nWhite Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan\\n\\n100%75%50%25%0%\\n\\nWhite Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan\\n\\n100%75%50%25%0%\\n\\n**Ingredients suitable for ma la xiang guo**\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou can use pretty much whatever your heart desires. Here are just some suggestions in case you need some ideas\\n\\n**1. Veggies**\\n\\n Veggies need to be bite-size or thinly sliced and usually blanched before stir-frying.\\n\\n You can use bok choy, cabbage, slices of carrots, baby corn, broccoli florets, shiitake mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, wood ear mushrooms, lotus roots, potato slices\\n\\n**2. Meat**\\n\\n Thinly sliced beef, chicken, pork, meatballs, luncheon meat (cut into cubes or slices), hot dogs (cut into cubes or slices)\\n\\n**3. Seafood**\\n\\n Shrimp, squid, fish cake slices, fish balls, surimi\\n\\n**4. Meatless protein**\\n\\n Beancurd sticks (soak until soft), extra-firm tofu (cut into cubes or slices), tempeh (cut into cubes or slices)\\n\\n**5. Noodles or carbs**\\n\\n Instant noodles, mung bean thread noodles, Korean sweet potato noodles, Chinese or Korean rice cakes\\n\\n**6. Low-carb options**\\n\\n Shirataki noodles, konnyaku jelly (cut into cubes)\\n\\n**How to cook easy ma la xiang guo at home**\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\n1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add cabbage, potatoes and lotus roots and blanch for about 1-2 minutes. Drain off water and refresh with cold water and set aside\\n\\n![Image 3](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-10.jpg)\\n\\n 2. Whatever noodles you use, cook them according to the instruction. I use instant ramen noodles. Don\\u2019t overcook the noodles\\n\\n![Image 4](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-1-1.jpg)\\n\\n 3. Preheat your skillet or wok. If you use ready-made ma la sauce, add about 3-4 Tbsp of the sauce, or in my case, I use 1/2 pack of Hai Di Lao ma la sauce. If you decide to do the homemade ma la sauce, add about 3 Tbsp of lao gan ma chili and Sichuan peppercorns. The amount is really up to your tolerance\\n\\n![Image 5](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-2.jpg)\\n\\n 4. Add the shrimp and stir fry until they just started to turn pink. If you use meat slices, add them here too. Add the fish cakes along with the blanched veggies, noodles and whole dried chilies. Add seasonings and stir to mix everything to make sure they are coated with the ma la sauce. Have a taste, at this point if you feel like you need more, you can add more of the ma la sauce. Turn off the heat\\n\\n![Image 6](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-4.jpg)\\n\\n 5. Add the toasted nuts, sesame seeds, green onion and give them a final toss to mix everything. Garnish with some fresh cilantro leaves. Serve immediately\\n\\n![Image 7](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-5.jpg)\\n\\nMa la xiang guo stir-fry is ready in no time \\ud83d\\ude42 My husband loves Sichuan peppercorns and so this dish is needless to say, one of his favorites.

Well, I\\u2019m going to call out a potential darkhorse dish which I hope will get it\\u2019s time on the podium soon - _Mala Dry Pot._\\n\\nNow, you may be thinking \\u201cWhat the heck is that, Phil?\\u201d - and I wouldn\\u2019t judge you. That\\u2019s because it seems to be a relatively niche dish at least here along the East Coast of the USA. I\\u2019ve only found it in 2 restaurants I\\u2019ve been to to date, and if you know how much I enjoy going to restaurants big and small, you know this dish must be a relatively rare thing. But I\\u2019ll let you in on a hint of what it is - you\\u2019ve probably heard of [Sichuan Hot Pot](https://thewoksoflife.com/hot-pot/), right? Those bubbling cauldrons of spicy, red-tinged and oil slicked broth where people are dunking in thin slices of meat, seafood, and vegetables and dipping them in all types of sauces? Well Mala Dry Pot is Hot Pot\\u2019s more assertive, bolder cousin - you know, the one that has a motorbike, enjoys wearing a leather jacket with a sherpa collar, and will go up to anyone at a bar and chat them up? That guy.\\n\\n_Anywho_ - Mala Dry Pot is a truly superior dish not only because it\\u2019s arguably event tastier than the more known Mala Hot Pot, but also because it\\u2019s easier to make and requires much less clean up and prep. If you\\u2019re a fan of spicy, savory food that will make you come back craving more, this one\\u2019s for you.\\n\\n_Let\\u2019s dive in._\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n**What is Chinese Mala Dry Pot?**So you may be thinking _\\"why is this dish a dark horse?\\"_ Well, aside from being relatively not well known at least in most parts of the USA, it has all the makings of a hype worthy dish. It\\u2019s full of bold flavor, it\'s infinitely customizable, it\'s very photogenic, and it\\u2019s made to be shared by a group - so you know it will be perfect for TikTokers to monologue over in a video. Once it starts gaining visibility as hot pot has, I expect it to enter the cultural zeitgeist in no time.\\n\\nSo what is Mala Dry Pot? To sum it up, it\\u2019s a spicy, savory, and very saucy stir fry at its heart. The \\u201cdry\\u201d of Mala Dry Pot comes from the fact that it\\u2019s not served in or with a full pot of broth like it\\u2019s cousin Sihuan hot pot is. While the mix of spices and flavors can vary, my preference, and how I\\u2019ve seen dry pot usually prepared, is choosing, prepping, and pre-cooking a mix of vegetables and proteins and quickly stir frying it with a sauce featuring a lively mix of spices, aromatics, soy and chili sauces, and fresh herbs to create a extremely fragrant, spicy, and tingly dish.\\n\\nThe core flavors of Mala dishes - szechuan peppercorn, chilis, cumin, star anise, and more feature right up front in Mala Dry Pot. These provide the robust base flavors while fresh herbs and vegetables act as the foil to bring brightness and balance. Honestly, it\\u2019s hard to describe in words, so please trust me when I say it\\u2019s a flavor I sometimes dream about.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n![Image 2: Picture](https://www.suitandapron.com/uploads/3/7/2/1/37213807/published/20221113-192718.jpg?1676238327)\\n\\nPrepping for Mala Dry Pot\\n\\nNow that I\\u2019ve hopefully sold you on giving this dish a try, there are a few steps in the lead up and prep for making dry pot. Here\\u2019s a few tips to start:\\n\\nBalance flavor and texture when picking your protein and vegetables - Remember, we eat with all our senses, so when picking what meat and proteins you want to include, get a variety of colors, textures, and flavors to really make it your own. I recommend selecting 2-3 proteins and at least 2-3 core vegetables for dry pot - that way you can enjoy mixing and matching bites.\\n\\n*   _Example Proteins:_\\n    *   Thinly sliced steak (use more tender cuts like sirloin or filet)\\n    *   Sliced chicken\\n    *   Spam\\n    *   Fried tofu (Unfried tofu may break apart)\\n    *   Shrimp\\n    *   Fish cakes or balls\\n\\n*   _Example Vegetables:_\\n    *   Bok choy\\n    *   Enoki or sliced shiitake mushrooms\\n    *   Chinese broccoli\\n    *   Bean sprouts\\n    *   Carrots\\n    *   Bamboo shoots\\n    *   Napa cabbage\\n    *   Lotus root\\n\\n*   _Other Ideas:_\\n    *   Mini dumplings or wontons\\n    *   Rice cakes\\n    *   Rice noodles\\n\\nPre-Cutting and Cooking your Ingredients - This is a critical step in making mala dry pot and helps make sure things go smoothly once you get to the final stages of cooking.\\n\\n*   _Make sure your pieces are all cut into large but bite-sized pieces_ - You don\\u2019t need something that is very small here. Cut your proteins and veg into pieces that are hearty, without making you have to unhinge your jaw\\n*   _Cook ingredients individually and have them set aside at the ready to go_ - The method you use here can vary, but I tend to like to brown and stir fry meats and hearty vegetables like carrots in oil until just cooked on the outside, and blanche leafy vegetables like bok choy until crisp-tender in a pot of salted boiling water. It\\u2019s ok if they cool down while you prep the other ingredients, you will heat them up again in the final stir fry with the sauce.\\n*   _Measure out your spices and sauces ahead of time_ - At the very end of cooking, you will be making the sauce for your dry pot and it will come together relatively quickly, so you don\\u2019t want to be fumbling around in the depths of your spice cabinet looking for cumin or bay leaves while your other spices are starting to burn. Pre-measure your spices and put them into a small dish and do the same with your liquid sauces. You can always adjust more later if you want more heat or salt or sugar. Also feel free to adjust your level of spice - add or reduce the amount of chili to your taste buds - no judgment here.\\n*   _Don\\u2019t skip on the fresh herbs_ - What takes Mala Dry Pot from A-Tier to S-Tier is the final topping of fresh herbs. Cilantro is traditional and preferred here, but fresh green onion is also wonderful and thai basil could also be a fun twist.\\n\\nHave Lots of Rice - Make more than you think you will need - I\\u2019m just going to leave it at that.\\n\\nAlright - well you\\u2019ve heard enough from me - here\\u2019s my recipe for a Mala Dry Pot. Again, my choice of meats and vegetables were purely based on what I was craving at the time, but I encourage you to create your own mix.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\nRecipe: Chinese Mala Dry Pot\\n\\nServes: 2-3\\n\\nIngredients:\\n\\n*   1/2 Can of Spam, sliced into bite-sized pieces\\n*   10-12 oz. Steak, sirloin or strip recommended, cut into bite-sized pieces\\n*   1 Large carrot, sliced thin into bite sized pieces\\n*   5-6 Napa cabbage leaves, cut into large pieces\\n*   2-3 Shanghai or Baby Bok Choy - Cut into fourths, leaving the base attached\\n*   1 Package sliced shiitake mushrooms - About 4 Oz (or substitute enoki mushrooms)\\n*   3-4 Cloves garlic, roughly chopped\\n*   1-inch Piece of ginger, roughly chopped\\n*   Handful of Cilantro, roughly chopped\\n*   1 tsp Sesame seeds\\n*   Vegetable Oil\\n\\nSauce and Spices:\\n\\n*   2 tsp Ground cumin\\n*   1 tsp Five spice\\n*   1-2 tsp Szechuan peppercorns, crushed between your fingertips until fragrant\\n*   1/2 - 3/4 tsp Szechuan or red pepper flakes\\n*   2 Bay leaves\\n*   2 Whole star anise\\n*   1 Tbl Light Soy Sauce\\n*   1 Tsp Dark Soy Sauce\\n*   1 Tbl White sugar\\n*   1 tsp Chinese black vinegar (substitute balsamic if needed)\\n*   1 tsp Shaoxing cooking wine (Substitute dry sherry if needed)\\n*   2 tsp. Spicy Chili Crisp\\n*   1 generous tsp Chili Bean Sauce (AKA [Touban Jian or Doubanjiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubanjiang))\\n*   Vegetable Oil\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\n1.   Prepare your meats and vegetables by slicing them into large, bite-sized pieces. Set aside until ready to cook\\n2.   Combine your dry spices on a small plate or bowl, and combine your sauces except for the chili-bean paste in a separate bowl. Set aside until ready to cook\\n3.   In a large pan, heat up a thin layer of oil and brown your proteins until just cooked and taking on brown color on the outside - set aside\\n4.   Cook your firm vegetables, like carrots, in the same pan until just starting to get tender, about 2-3 minutes - set aside\\n5.   Cook your mushrooms until they have released their liquids and are soft - about 3-5 minutes - set aside\\n6.   In a large pot of boiling salted water, quickly blanche your napa cabbage and bok choy for 1-2 minutes until cooked but still crisp - remove from the water and set aside\\n7.   Once all main proteins and vegetables are prepared, return the large pan over medium-low heat. Add about 3 tablespoons of oil to the pan and add the dry spices, garlic, and ginger. Stir until spices are fragrant - about 1 minute.\\n8.   Add the chili bean paste and stir into the oil mixture - cook 1-minute more until fragrant\\n9.   Add the remaining sauce ingredients, raise the heat to medium, and bring to a boil\\n10.   Turn heat to medium-high and add all the prepped proteins and vegetables back into the pan. Stir to coat all the ingredients in the sauce and let the sauce start to thicken and glaze everything - 2-3 minutes. Taste and adjust the dish as needed with salt, sugar, or chili to taste. If the sauce is too loose, you can thicken it with a cornstarch slurry.\\n11.   Remove the pan from the heat and dish onto a large serving dish or platter - sprinkle generously with fresh chopped cilantro and a sprinkle of sesame seeds\\n12.   Serve family style with lots of rice and enjoy\\n\\nLet me know if you enjoyed trying this out in the comments below. _**Cheers!**_\\n\\n![Image 3](https://www.suitandapron.com/uploads/3/7/2/1/37213807/20221113-183652_orig.jpg)Suit and Apron -------------- No celebrity chef got to the top without getting burned, cut, and spilled on at least a couple dozen times.

It is known for its spiciness and numbing \\u201cmala\\u201d taste, the dish combines _Sichuan peppercorn_ s and c _hili peppers_ to create a fiery and tingling flavor. This signature taste is unique to Sichuan cuisine, where preservation and intense flavors were used to cope with the region\\u2019s hot and humid climate. Mala Dry Hotpot is a more recent twist on the traditional Sichuan hotpot, which uses a spicy broth. Instead, this \\u201cdry\\u201d version incorporates a stir-fry technique for a more concentrated flavor and texture!\\n\\nThe taste of Mala Dry Hotpot is complex. The Sichuan peppercorns create a tingling sensation on the tongue, while the chilies add heat without overpowering the ingredients in this dish. The ingredients are combined with a variety of spices and sauces, making every bite flavorful and rich.\\n\\nMala Dry Hotpot is a great Sichuan recipe. You prepare this dish by stir-frying. After the prepping the ingredients, they\\u2019re briefly blanched to maintain their crispness. The sauce base, made from Sichuan peppercorns, chilies, garlic, ginger, and doubanjiang (fermented broad bean paste), is cooked until fragrant to release its full aroma. Then, the blanched ingredients are added and stir-fried together, allowing them to absorb the intense flavors of the sauce. The dish is finished with sesame oil, along with optional fresh herbs like cilantro.\\n\\n![Image 6: Sichuan recipe, dry hotpot, mala dry hotpot, dry mala hotpot](https://highkeitasty.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC_6543.jpg)\\n\\nIngredients\\n-----------\\n\\n**Sichuan peppercorns** creates the classic \\u201cmala\\u201d effect, these peppercorns provide a unique numbing sensation and citrusy aroma, balancing the intense heat with a tingling freshness. This is a classic ingredient in most Sichuan recipe.\\n\\n**Dried red chilies** add a fiery heat to the dish, forming the \\u201cla\\u201d (spicy) part of the mala flavor.

Ingredients of Mala include Sichuan peppercorns (Hua Jiao) giving the special numbing feeling, chili pepper, bean paste, garlic, ginger, cinnamon, star anise, fennel, and black cardamom, vegetable oil and salt. These mixed and blended ingredients help create the signature flavourful taste of Mala.\\n\\nYou may be wondering: Wow, there are so many different types of herbs and spices in this Mala. Is it possibly healthy for me?\\n\\n**![Image 3](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2dAQYm8iq7RnblN0fBheQWS_hatDhMsfWnWcn27-0MO5sZ2UCASjlrJVmLxQTjKWkhTRivnmDvGvBB4kmxuZNhKtJAPs9zMW8wBlcoArlmu2DCBWK4-pRRzYOjA1wO7b3vq8C2c)**\\n\\nIt was claimed that **capsaicin in the spice blends help boost your metabolism, enabling you to quickly lose weight and burn fat**. Moreover, dried chili is a good source of vitamins A, B, C and contains minerals such as folate, potassium and thiamine. Spices such as Sichuan peppercorn also have an effect on cardiovascular health and may increase life expectancy.\\n\\nThis sounds like great news, aint it? But wait! Scroll down to read more!\\n\\n**Downside Of Mala**\\n--------------------\\n\\nCardiologist Calvin Chin from the National Heart Centre Singapore warned that **although chili may boost our metabolism, the weight lost will be modest**. You will need to eat chili everyday for more than 3 or 4 months to lose 1 kg?! The effects of losing weight from chili will also reduce over time once your chili tolerance builds up over time.\\n\\nOther problems of Mala dishes include a **high sodium content**. According to a test shown by CNA, 100g of Mala broth has an average of 418 mg of sodium, whereas 100g of stir-fried Mala has 470 mg of sodium. The Mala dish salt content is significantly higher than other dishes such as mutton biryani (163mg sodium/ 100g) and laksa (294mg sodium/ 100g).\\n\\n**![Image 4](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/h9QSkKt0omX6kYQeSYtQKIVEaRPu0iF1Y6BmuR4fwRMCaivUwYBO8bmp9u6BlHBX8-ahtj6K6wR-XjCL30KNabSx-pn3rc3uyMlBu4SAn6In7ZwMZIDQeKsGVBqz6OxnTb6a9Mg)**\\n\\nAdditionally, other ingredients added into your mala hotpot will add extra sodium levels to the dish, which may accumulate to 1000mg or even exceed the recommended daily salt intake of 2000mg by the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/news/item/31-01-2013-who-issues-new-guidance-on-dietary-salt-and-potassium#:~:text=Adults%20should%20consume%20less%20than,guidelines%20issued%20by%20the%20WHO.). Excessive salt content in your body can increase the risk of high blood pressure and kidney problems.\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s more, Mala is packed with **high saturated fat and trans-fat**. An average Mala can contain up to 6g of fat per each 100g, depending on the ingredients in the dish. 100g stir-fried mala has an average of 3.8g saturated fat while 100g of mala hotpot oily layer has 4.9g saturated fat. Besides, if you want a more spicy tasting Mala, the waiter will add more chili oil, increasing the saturated fat in your hotpot! On average, an adult should not exceed more than 22g of saturated fat per day.\\n\\nProlonged heating of the soup can also convert good healthy unsaturated fat like polyunsaturated fat into bad unhealthy trans-fatty acids and saturated fatty acids. The presence of toxins, carcinogens and free radicals of high temperature cooked food will definitely be detrimental for our health!\\n\\n**How To Have A Healthier Mala Meal**\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\n![Image 5](https://admin.doc2us.com/storage/article_media/media_2022013108574592.png)\\n\\nEating in moderation is key to your health! You can control your portion and choose quality ingredients when ordering Mala!\\n\\n1.   **To reduce saturated fats**, you can opt to remove the oil at the top of the broth after the ingredients are cooked in your Mala hotpot. Include more fresh leafy vegetables such as mushroom, cabbage, lettuce or spinach in your hotpot and blanch the vegetables instead of leaving them to cook fully in the hotpot which will absorb more of the oil.\\n\\n Eating more lean meat over fat such as fresh chicken, seafood or fish is a food source of lean protein. Do take note that fatty fried food such as deep-fried tofu skin, fried yam, and pork belly may absorb double the amount of oil in your hotpot!\\n\\n2.   **To reduce the sodium level**, you can ask for less dipping sauce or paste and less chili oil in your hotpot or other Mala dish. For a light dipping sauce, you can ask for minced garlic, fresh cut chili with soy sauce, and vinegar sauce.\\n\\n Processed food such as crab sticks, meatballs, luncheon meat and hot dogs are high in sodium, thus you may want to try to limit these!\\n\\n3.   **Watch out for repeated boiling of your hot pot broth!** If the broth is already boiled for more than 90 minutes, it may increase nitrite levels [(Yahoo! News)](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/fit-to-post-health/8-tips-healthy-chinese-hot-pot-071522300.html). Nitrite, created directly in food through high heat cooking is carcinogenic and is linked with bowel cancer if consumed in high amounts. Thus, you may want to set a time limit when boiling your hotpot!\\n\\nYou can also try to control your urge to eat Mala by only eating it once or twice a month with your friends and family! You are what you eat, remember to not overeat your Mala and stay healthy and energized! Have a happy and blessed Chinese New Year!\\n\\n**A WORD FROM DOC2US**\\n----------------------\\n\\nIf you have any questions related to _any medical conditions_, you can consult our professional doctors and healthcare professionals on DOC2US.

Almost every hawker centre now has this stir fried dish where you can customise the vegetables, proteins and noodles that go in. You can also choose your spice level and add garnishes like cilantro and peanuts if you prefer. Overall, the customisation of the dish ensures anyone and everyone is able to enjoy it and no matter what it\\u2019s packed with flavour!\\n\\nAnd it\\u2019s not just the chillies that flavour this dish \\u2013 it also includes spices like garlic, sichuan pepper, 5-spice powder and most importantly, hot bean paste. It\\u2019s usually shared between 2 to even more than 6 people sometimes with a huge mega dry pot. It\\u2019s crazy how much people love eating Mala Xiang Guo as a social experience (myself included!)\\n\\nIn restaurants, there are so many delectable dishes to select from \\u2013 you can pick your choice of protein, different types of beancurd, and vegetables. There is really no right or wrong way to construct your bowl but generally if it\\u2019s just the two of us \\u2013 were pick around 4-5 dishes in a reasonable quantity.\\n\\n![Image 2](https://browngirlveganeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/photo1705849696-1.jpeg)\\n\\nI used to be so crazy about this dish once that I swore my future partner had to like this dish if not we were just not meant to be \\u2013 I got lucky that my partner loves it too ![Image 3: \\ud83d\\ude09](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/svg/1f609.svg) However, I always preferred to prepare this dish at home as it was much healthier than ones you find outside (sometimes it\\u2019s loaded with oils and you can\\u2019t really tell if it\\u2019s truly vegan unless it\\u2019s a vegetarian place). My favourite vegan mala dry pot has got to be Green On Earth, Rail Mall \\u2013 you\\u2019ve got to try it if you are ever in Singapore!\\n\\nIngredients You Need\\n--------------------\\n\\n*   **sesame oil** \\u2013 toasted sesame oil is a BIG pantry staple for me and we use this as a base oil in this recipe!\\n*   **hot bean paste** \\u2013 this is a secret ingredient for that flavour in mala xiang guo. Unfortunately, this paste is not gluten free.\\n*   **aromatics** \\u2013 garlic and ginger. You can omit garlic and substitute with hing if you are alliums free.\\n*   **chillies** \\u2013 you can customise the number of dried red chillies depending on the spice level you prefer. Medium spice calls for about 4-5 red chili peppers. \\n*   **shaoxing wine** \\u2013 you can substitute this with rice wine vinegar or regular white vinegar. \\n*   **spices** \\u2013 5-spice powder and ground sichuan pepper\\n*   **sauces** \\u2013 light and dark soy sauces \\n*   **vegetables** \\u2013 you can use any veggies you like but I added lotus root, bok choy, fried tofu, oyster mushrooms, beancurd skin and ramen noodles. \\n\\nThis sichuan-style mala stirfry is what dreams are made of \\u2013 packed with veggies, protein, and a whole lot of spice and numbingness for that authentic taste.\\n\\nPrep Time 5 minutes\\n\\nTotal Time 15 minutes\\n\\nCourse: Main Course\\n\\nCuisine: Chinese\\n\\nKeyword: chinese, noodles\\n\\nServings: 2\\n\\n*   2 tbsp sesame oil\\n*   2 tbsp hot bean paste\\n*   1 tsp minced ginger\\n*   2 cloves garlic\\n*   4-5 dried red chillies deseeded\\n*   2 tbsp peanuts\\n*   1.5 tbsp shaoxing wine\\n*   1.5 tbsp light soy sauce\\n*   1 tsp 5-spice powder\\n*   1 tsp sichuan pepper\\n*   1/2 tbsp dark soy sauce\\n\\n#### Toppings\\n\\n*   8-10 slices lotus root\\n*   4 bunches bok choy\\n*   150 g extra firm tofu\\n*   150 g oyster mushrooms\\n*   beancurd skin\\n*   2 stalks scallions\\n*   1 serving ramen\\n\\n#### Garnish\\n\\n*   toasted sesame seeds\\n*   chopped cilantro \\n*   chili sesame oil\\n*   1 serving rice for sharing\\n\\n*   Cube tofu and pan fry in olive oil until crispy.

Please read our [disclosure policy.](https://whattocooktoday.com/disclosure-and-privacy-policy)_\\n\\n**If you love spicy numbing food, then you need to meet ma la xiang guo. It is spicy and numbing, yet you can\\u2019t stop eating it. I\\u2019m sharing how you can easily make ma la xiang guo at home using hai di lao mala sauce and also how you can make your own mala sauce if you choose to.**\\n\\n![Image 1: Easy Ma La Xiang Guo At Home (Spicy Numbing Stir-fry)](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-8.jpg)\\n\\n I remember a few years ago when we were visiting Chicago, my husband found this Sichuan restaurant and we were craving spicy food then and I immediately ordered ma la xiang guo. The portion was HUGE! I mean, HUGE! It was filled with TONS of seafood and meat and oh gosh\\u2026lots of Sichuan peppercorns and the super spicy ma la sauce. I considered myself a person who can really eat spicy food and this ma la xiang guo was off the chart spicy! LOL AND numbing! but we loved it so much!\\n\\n Spicy ma la food sure has caught its trend in Singapore or I should say, outside of China, in recent years. From the spicy mala hot pot and now the dry version of hot pot, the ma la xiang guo! When you eat ma la xiang guo in restaurants, you picked your ingredients, they will weigh them on the scale (yup!) and the cook will fry up ma la xian guo using what you picked! It can cost you quite a bit. I think ma la xiang guo made at home is just as delicious, and the nice thing about it is that, you can use whatever ingredients you have leftover or you can go all out and put in whatever you fancy.\\n\\n**Easy Homemade Ma la Sauce vs Hai Di Lau Ma la sauce**\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf this is your first time making ma la xiang guo, I suggest using the [Hai Di Lau ma la basic stir-fry sauce](https://amzn.to/3dTUko3) (not sponsored). It\\u2019s just so much more convenient and it gives you that satisfying level of spiciness and numbness. I actually use the Hai Di Lau ma la hotpot sauce that I purchased for making hotpot but didn\\u2019t end up using it. They are very similar. You are of course, welcome to use whatever ma la stir-fry sauce you like, you don\\u2019t have to use this brand. For homemade ma la sauce I\\u2019ve tried using [Lao Gan Ma chili crisp in oil](https://amzn.to/3yOLtfv) and then add some Szechuan peppercorns and some seasonings and it actually turns out pretty good too.\\n\\n![Image 2: Easy Ma La Xiang Guo At Home (Spicy Numbing Stir-fry)](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-9.jpg)\\n\\n### MY LATEST VIDEOS\\n\\nnext\\n\\nstay\\n\\nCC\\n\\nSettings Off Arabic Chinese English French German Hindi Portuguese Spanish\\n\\nFont Color white Font Opacity 100%Font Size 100%Font Family Arial Text Shadow none Background Color black Background Opacity 50%Window Color black Window Opacity 0%\\n\\nWhite Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan\\n\\n100%75%50%25%\\n\\n200%175%150%125%100%75%50%\\n\\nArial Georgia Garamond Courier New Tahoma Times New Roman Trebuchet MS Verdana\\n\\nNone Raised Depressed Uniform Drop Shadow\\n\\nWhite Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan\\n\\n100%75%50%25%0%\\n\\nWhite Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan\\n\\n100%75%50%25%0%\\n\\n**Ingredients suitable for ma la xiang guo**\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou can use pretty much whatever your heart desires. Here are just some suggestions in case you need some ideas\\n\\n**1. Veggies**\\n\\n Veggies need to be bite-size or thinly sliced and usually blanched before stir-frying.\\n\\n You can use bok choy, cabbage, slices of carrots, baby corn, broccoli florets, shiitake mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, wood ear mushrooms, lotus roots, potato slices\\n\\n**2. Meat**\\n\\n Thinly sliced beef, chicken, pork, meatballs, luncheon meat (cut into cubes or slices), hot dogs (cut into cubes or slices)\\n\\n**3. Seafood**\\n\\n Shrimp, squid, fish cake slices, fish balls, surimi\\n\\n**4. Meatless protein**\\n\\n Beancurd sticks (soak until soft), extra-firm tofu (cut into cubes or slices), tempeh (cut into cubes or slices)\\n\\n**5. Noodles or carbs**\\n\\n Instant noodles, mung bean thread noodles, Korean sweet potato noodles, Chinese or Korean rice cakes\\n\\n**6. Low-carb options**\\n\\n Shirataki noodles, konnyaku jelly (cut into cubes)\\n\\n**How to cook easy ma la xiang guo at home**\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\n1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add cabbage, potatoes and lotus roots and blanch for about 1-2 minutes. Drain off water and refresh with cold water and set aside\\n\\n![Image 3](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-10.jpg)\\n\\n 2. Whatever noodles you use, cook them according to the instruction. I use instant ramen noodles. Don\\u2019t overcook the noodles\\n\\n![Image 4](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-1-1.jpg)\\n\\n 3. Preheat your skillet or wok. If you use ready-made ma la sauce, add about 3-4 Tbsp of the sauce, or in my case, I use 1/2 pack of Hai Di Lao ma la sauce. If you decide to do the homemade ma la sauce, add about 3 Tbsp of lao gan ma chili and Sichuan peppercorns. The amount is really up to your tolerance\\n\\n![Image 5](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-2.jpg)\\n\\n 4. Add the shrimp and stir fry until they just started to turn pink. If you use meat slices, add them here too. Add the fish cakes along with the blanched veggies, noodles and whole dried chilies. Add seasonings and stir to mix everything to make sure they are coated with the ma la sauce. Have a taste, at this point if you feel like you need more, you can add more of the ma la sauce. Turn off the heat\\n\\n![Image 6](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-4.jpg)\\n\\n 5. Add the toasted nuts, sesame seeds, green onion and give them a final toss to mix everything. Garnish with some fresh cilantro leaves. Serve immediately\\n\\n![Image 7](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ma-la-xiang-guo-5.jpg)\\n\\nMa la xiang guo stir-fry is ready in no time \\ud83d\\ude42 My husband loves Sichuan peppercorns and so this dish is needless to say, one of his favorites.

Well, I\\u2019m going to call out a potential darkhorse dish which I hope will get it\\u2019s time on the podium soon - _Mala Dry Pot._\\n\\nNow, you may be thinking \\u201cWhat the heck is that, Phil?\\u201d - and I wouldn\\u2019t judge you. That\\u2019s because it seems to be a relatively niche dish at least here along the East Coast of the USA. I\\u2019ve only found it in 2 restaurants I\\u2019ve been to to date, and if you know how much I enjoy going to restaurants big and small, you know this dish must be a relatively rare thing. But I\\u2019ll let you in on a hint of what it is - you\\u2019ve probably heard of [Sichuan Hot Pot](https://thewoksoflife.com/hot-pot/), right? Those bubbling cauldrons of spicy, red-tinged and oil slicked broth where people are dunking in thin slices of meat, seafood, and vegetables and dipping them in all types of sauces? Well Mala Dry Pot is Hot Pot\\u2019s more assertive, bolder cousin - you know, the one that has a motorbike, enjoys wearing a leather jacket with a sherpa collar, and will go up to anyone at a bar and chat them up? That guy.\\n\\n_Anywho_ - Mala Dry Pot is a truly superior dish not only because it\\u2019s arguably event tastier than the more known Mala Hot Pot, but also because it\\u2019s easier to make and requires much less clean up and prep. If you\\u2019re a fan of spicy, savory food that will make you come back craving more, this one\\u2019s for you.\\n\\n_Let\\u2019s dive in._\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n**What is Chinese Mala Dry Pot?**So you may be thinking _\\"why is this dish a dark horse?\\"_ Well, aside from being relatively not well known at least in most parts of the USA, it has all the makings of a hype worthy dish. It\\u2019s full of bold flavor, it\'s infinitely customizable, it\'s very photogenic, and it\\u2019s made to be shared by a group - so you know it will be perfect for TikTokers to monologue over in a video. Once it starts gaining visibility as hot pot has, I expect it to enter the cultural zeitgeist in no time.\\n\\nSo what is Mala Dry Pot? To sum it up, it\\u2019s a spicy, savory, and very saucy stir fry at its heart. The \\u201cdry\\u201d of Mala Dry Pot comes from the fact that it\\u2019s not served in or with a full pot of broth like it\\u2019s cousin Sihuan hot pot is. While the mix of spices and flavors can vary, my preference, and how I\\u2019ve seen dry pot usually prepared, is choosing, prepping, and pre-cooking a mix of vegetables and proteins and quickly stir frying it with a sauce featuring a lively mix of spices, aromatics, soy and chili sauces, and fresh herbs to create a extremely fragrant, spicy, and tingly dish.\\n\\nThe core flavors of Mala dishes - szechuan peppercorn, chilis, cumin, star anise, and more feature right up front in Mala Dry Pot. These provide the robust base flavors while fresh herbs and vegetables act as the foil to bring brightness and balance. Honestly, it\\u2019s hard to describe in words, so please trust me when I say it\\u2019s a flavor I sometimes dream about.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n![Image 2: Picture](https://www.suitandapron.com/uploads/3/7/2/1/37213807/published/20221113-192718.jpg?1676238327)\\n\\nPrepping for Mala Dry Pot\\n\\nNow that I\\u2019ve hopefully sold you on giving this dish a try, there are a few steps in the lead up and prep for making dry pot. Here\\u2019s a few tips to start:\\n\\nBalance flavor and texture when picking your protein and vegetables - Remember, we eat with all our senses, so when picking what meat and proteins you want to include, get a variety of colors, textures, and flavors to really make it your own. I recommend selecting 2-3 proteins and at least 2-3 core vegetables for dry pot - that way you can enjoy mixing and matching bites.\\n\\n*   _Example Proteins:_\\n    *   Thinly sliced steak (use more tender cuts like sirloin or filet)\\n    *   Sliced chicken\\n    *   Spam\\n    *   Fried tofu (Unfried tofu may break apart)\\n    *   Shrimp\\n    *   Fish cakes or balls\\n\\n*   _Example Vegetables:_\\n    *   Bok choy\\n    *   Enoki or sliced shiitake mushrooms\\n    *   Chinese broccoli\\n    *   Bean sprouts\\n    *   Carrots\\n    *   Bamboo shoots\\n    *   Napa cabbage\\n    *   Lotus root\\n\\n*   _Other Ideas:_\\n    *   Mini dumplings or wontons\\n    *   Rice cakes\\n    *   Rice noodles\\n\\nPre-Cutting and Cooking your Ingredients - This is a critical step in making mala dry pot and helps make sure things go smoothly once you get to the final stages of cooking.\\n\\n*   _Make sure your pieces are all cut into large but bite-sized pieces_ - You don\\u2019t need something that is very small here. Cut your proteins and veg into pieces that are hearty, without making you have to unhinge your jaw\\n*   _Cook ingredients individually and have them set aside at the ready to go_ - The method you use here can vary, but I tend to like to brown and stir fry meats and hearty vegetables like carrots in oil until just cooked on the outside, and blanche leafy vegetables like bok choy until crisp-tender in a pot of salted boiling water. It\\u2019s ok if they cool down while you prep the other ingredients, you will heat them up again in the final stir fry with the sauce.\\n*   _Measure out your spices and sauces ahead of time_ - At the very end of cooking, you will be making the sauce for your dry pot and it will come together relatively quickly, so you don\\u2019t want to be fumbling around in the depths of your spice cabinet looking for cumin or bay leaves while your other spices are starting to burn. Pre-measure your spices and put them into a small dish and do the same with your liquid sauces. You can always adjust more later if you want more heat or salt or sugar. Also feel free to adjust your level of spice - add or reduce the amount of chili to your taste buds - no judgment here.\\n*   _Don\\u2019t skip on the fresh herbs_ - What takes Mala Dry Pot from A-Tier to S-Tier is the final topping of fresh herbs. Cilantro is traditional and preferred here, but fresh green onion is also wonderful and thai basil could also be a fun twist.\\n\\nHave Lots of Rice - Make more than you think you will need - I\\u2019m just going to leave it at that.\\n\\nAlright - well you\\u2019ve heard enough from me - here\\u2019s my recipe for a Mala Dry Pot. Again, my choice of meats and vegetables were purely based on what I was craving at the time, but I encourage you to create your own mix.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\nRecipe: Chinese Mala Dry Pot\\n\\nServes: 2-3\\n\\nIngredients:\\n\\n*   1/2 Can of Spam, sliced into bite-sized pieces\\n*   10-12 oz. Steak, sirloin or strip recommended, cut into bite-sized pieces\\n*   1 Large carrot, sliced thin into bite sized pieces\\n*   5-6 Napa cabbage leaves, cut into large pieces\\n*   2-3 Shanghai or Baby Bok Choy - Cut into fourths, leaving the base attached\\n*   1 Package sliced shiitake mushrooms - About 4 Oz (or substitute enoki mushrooms)\\n*   3-4 Cloves garlic, roughly chopped\\n*   1-inch Piece of ginger, roughly chopped\\n*   Handful of Cilantro, roughly chopped\\n*   1 tsp Sesame seeds\\n*   Vegetable Oil\\n\\nSauce and Spices:\\n\\n*   2 tsp Ground cumin\\n*   1 tsp Five spice\\n*   1-2 tsp Szechuan peppercorns, crushed between your fingertips until fragrant\\n*   1/2 - 3/4 tsp Szechuan or red pepper flakes\\n*   2 Bay leaves\\n*   2 Whole star anise\\n*   1 Tbl Light Soy Sauce\\n*   1 Tsp Dark Soy Sauce\\n*   1 Tbl White sugar\\n*   1 tsp Chinese black vinegar (substitute balsamic if needed)\\n*   1 tsp Shaoxing cooking wine (Substitute dry sherry if needed)\\n*   2 tsp. Spicy Chili Crisp\\n*   1 generous tsp Chili Bean Sauce (AKA [Touban Jian or Doubanjiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubanjiang))\\n*   Vegetable Oil\\n\\nDirections:\\n\\n1.   Prepare your meats and vegetables by slicing them into large, bite-sized pieces. Set aside until ready to cook\\n2.   Combine your dry spices on a small plate or bowl, and combine your sauces except for the chili-bean paste in a separate bowl. Set aside until ready to cook\\n3.   In a large pan, heat up a thin layer of oil and brown your proteins until just cooked and taking on brown color on the outside - set aside\\n4.   Cook your firm vegetables, like carrots, in the same pan until just starting to get tender, about 2-3 minutes - set aside\\n5.   Cook your mushrooms until they have released their liquids and are soft - about 3-5 minutes - set aside\\n6.   In a large pot of boiling salted water, quickly blanche your napa cabbage and bok choy for 1-2 minutes until cooked but still crisp - remove from the water and set aside\\n7.   Once all main proteins and vegetables are prepared, return the large pan over medium-low heat. Add about 3 tablespoons of oil to the pan and add the dry spices, garlic, and ginger. Stir until spices are fragrant - about 1 minute.\\n8.   Add the chili bean paste and stir into the oil mixture - cook 1-minute more until fragrant\\n9.   Add the remaining sauce ingredients, raise the heat to medium, and bring to a boil\\n10.   Turn heat to medium-high and add all the prepped proteins and vegetables back into the pan. Stir to coat all the ingredients in the sauce and let the sauce start to thicken and glaze everything - 2-3 minutes. Taste and adjust the dish as needed with salt, sugar, or chili to taste. If the sauce is too loose, you can thicken it with a cornstarch slurry.\\n11.   Remove the pan from the heat and dish onto a large serving dish or platter - sprinkle generously with fresh chopped cilantro and a sprinkle of sesame seeds\\n12.   Serve family style with lots of rice and enjoy\\n\\nLet me know if you enjoyed trying this out in the comments below. _**Cheers!**_\\n\\n![Image 3](https://www.suitandapron.com/uploads/3/7/2/1/37213807/20221113-183652_orig.jpg)Suit and Apron -------------- No celebrity chef got to the top without getting burned, cut, and spilled on at least a couple dozen times.

It is known for its spiciness and numbing \\u201cmala\\u201d taste, the dish combines _Sichuan peppercorn_ s and c _hili peppers_ to create a fiery and tingling flavor. This signature taste is unique to Sichuan cuisine, where preservation and intense flavors were used to cope with the region\\u2019s hot and humid climate. Mala Dry Hotpot is a more recent twist on the traditional Sichuan hotpot, which uses a spicy broth. Instead, this \\u201cdry\\u201d version incorporates a stir-fry technique for a more concentrated flavor and texture!\\n\\nThe taste of Mala Dry Hotpot is complex. The Sichuan peppercorns create a tingling sensation on the tongue, while the chilies add heat without overpowering the ingredients in this dish. The ingredients are combined with a variety of spices and sauces, making every bite flavorful and rich.\\n\\nMala Dry Hotpot is a great Sichuan recipe. You prepare this dish by stir-frying. After the prepping the ingredients, they\\u2019re briefly blanched to maintain their crispness. The sauce base, made from Sichuan peppercorns, chilies, garlic, ginger, and doubanjiang (fermented broad bean paste), is cooked until fragrant to release its full aroma. Then, the blanched ingredients are added and stir-fried together, allowing them to absorb the intense flavors of the sauce. The dish is finished with sesame oil, along with optional fresh herbs like cilantro.\\n\\n![Image 6: Sichuan recipe, dry hotpot, mala dry hotpot, dry mala hotpot](https://highkeitasty.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC_6543.jpg)\\n\\nIngredients\\n-----------\\n\\n**Sichuan peppercorns** creates the classic \\u201cmala\\u201d effect, these peppercorns provide a unique numbing sensation and citrusy aroma, balancing the intense heat with a tingling freshness. This is a classic ingredient in most Sichuan recipe.\\n\\n**Dried red chilies** add a fiery heat to the dish, forming the \\u201cla\\u201d (spicy) part of the mala flavor.

Ingredients of Mala include Sichuan peppercorns (Hua Jiao) giving the special numbing feeling, chili pepper, bean paste, garlic, ginger, cinnamon, star anise, fennel, and black cardamom, vegetable oil and salt. These mixed and blended ingredients help create the signature flavourful taste of Mala.\\n\\nYou may be wondering: Wow, there are so many different types of herbs and spices in this Mala. Is it possibly healthy for me?\\n\\n**![Image 3](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2dAQYm8iq7RnblN0fBheQWS_hatDhMsfWnWcn27-0MO5sZ2UCASjlrJVmLxQTjKWkhTRivnmDvGvBB4kmxuZNhKtJAPs9zMW8wBlcoArlmu2DCBWK4-pRRzYOjA1wO7b3vq8C2c)**\\n\\nIt was claimed that **capsaicin in the spice blends help boost your metabolism, enabling you to quickly lose weight and burn fat**. Moreover, dried chili is a good source of vitamins A, B, C and contains minerals such as folate, potassium and thiamine. Spices such as Sichuan peppercorn also have an effect on cardiovascular health and may increase life expectancy.\\n\\nThis sounds like great news, aint it? But wait! Scroll down to read more!\\n\\n**Downside Of Mala**\\n--------------------\\n\\nCardiologist Calvin Chin from the National Heart Centre Singapore warned that **although chili may boost our metabolism, the weight lost will be modest**. You will need to eat chili everyday for more than 3 or 4 months to lose 1 kg?! The effects of losing weight from chili will also reduce over time once your chili tolerance builds up over time.\\n\\nOther problems of Mala dishes include a **high sodium content**. According to a test shown by CNA, 100g of Mala broth has an average of 418 mg of sodium, whereas 100g of stir-fried Mala has 470 mg of sodium. The Mala dish salt content is significantly higher than other dishes such as mutton biryani (163mg sodium/ 100g) and laksa (294mg sodium/ 100g).\\n\\n**![Image 4](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/h9QSkKt0omX6kYQeSYtQKIVEaRPu0iF1Y6BmuR4fwRMCaivUwYBO8bmp9u6BlHBX8-ahtj6K6wR-XjCL30KNabSx-pn3rc3uyMlBu4SAn6In7ZwMZIDQeKsGVBqz6OxnTb6a9Mg)**\\n\\nAdditionally, other ingredients added into your mala hotpot will add extra sodium levels to the dish, which may accumulate to 1000mg or even exceed the recommended daily salt intake of 2000mg by the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/news/item/31-01-2013-who-issues-new-guidance-on-dietary-salt-and-potassium#:~:text=Adults%20should%20consume%20less%20than,guidelines%20issued%20by%20the%20WHO.). Excessive salt content in your body can increase the risk of high blood pressure and kidney problems.\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s more, Mala is packed with **high saturated fat and trans-fat**. An average Mala can contain up to 6g of fat per each 100g, depending on the ingredients in the dish. 100g stir-fried mala has an average of 3.8g saturated fat while 100g of mala hotpot oily layer has 4.9g saturated fat. Besides, if you want a more spicy tasting Mala, the waiter will add more chili oil, increasing the saturated fat in your hotpot! On average, an adult should not exceed more than 22g of saturated fat per day.\\n\\nProlonged heating of the soup can also convert good healthy unsaturated fat like polyunsaturated fat into bad unhealthy trans-fatty acids and saturated fatty acids. The presence of toxins, carcinogens and free radicals of high temperature cooked food will definitely be detrimental for our health!\\n\\n**How To Have A Healthier Mala Meal**\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\n![Image 5](https://admin.doc2us.com/storage/article_media/media_2022013108574592.png)\\n\\nEating in moderation is key to your health! You can control your portion and choose quality ingredients when ordering Mala!\\n\\n1.   **To reduce saturated fats**, you can opt to remove the oil at the top of the broth after the ingredients are cooked in your Mala hotpot. Include more fresh leafy vegetables such as mushroom, cabbage, lettuce or spinach in your hotpot and blanch the vegetables instead of leaving them to cook fully in the hotpot which will absorb more of the oil.\\n\\n Eating more lean meat over fat such as fresh chicken, seafood or fish is a food source of lean protein. Do take note that fatty fried food such as deep-fried tofu skin, fried yam, and pork belly may absorb double the amount of oil in your hotpot!\\n\\n2.   **To reduce the sodium level**, you can ask for less dipping sauce or paste and less chili oil in your hotpot or other Mala dish. For a light dipping sauce, you can ask for minced garlic, fresh cut chili with soy sauce, and vinegar sauce.\\n\\n Processed food such as crab sticks, meatballs, luncheon meat and hot dogs are high in sodium, thus you may want to try to limit these!\\n\\n3.   **Watch out for repeated boiling of your hot pot broth!** If the broth is already boiled for more than 90 minutes, it may increase nitrite levels [(Yahoo! News)](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/fit-to-post-health/8-tips-healthy-chinese-hot-pot-071522300.html). Nitrite, created directly in food through high heat cooking is carcinogenic and is linked with bowel cancer if consumed in high amounts. Thus, you may want to set a time limit when boiling your hotpot!\\n\\nYou can also try to control your urge to eat Mala by only eating it once or twice a month with your friends and family! You are what you eat, remember to not overeat your Mala and stay healthy and energized! Have a happy and blessed Chinese New Year!\\n\\n**A WORD FROM DOC2US**\\n----------------------\\n\\nIf you have any questions related to _any medical conditions_, you can consult our professional doctors and healthcare professionals on DOC2US.
